  "raw_response": "Now I understand the structure. The Marine DCF sheet currently has:\n- Column J = 2023 (historical)\n- Column K = 2024 (projection year 1)\n- Columns L-P = 2025-2029 (projection years 2-6)\n\nI need to:\n1. Update column K (FY2024) with LQA values from Model Shell\n2. Shift the DCF so 2025 becomes year 1 (L2 should be 1, not 2)\n\nLet me check the Model Shell LQA values more carefully:\nNow I understand. The Marine DCF sheet needs to be updated:\n\n1. Column K (FY2024) should use LQA values from Model Shell column G\n2. The DCF year counter in row 2 needs to shift so L2=1 (2025 is year 1)\n\nLet me create the update script:\nNow let me verify the calculated values by using a Python library that can evaluate Excel formulas, or by checking the structure more carefully:\nI see there's an issue. The terminal value calculation needs to be rechecked. Let me look at the original R column formulas more carefully:\nNow I understand the terminal value formula. R25 = (R21/(S24-S26))*Q24, which means the terminal value is discounted using Q24 (the PV factor for year Q2).\n\nWith L2=1, the year numbers shift:\n- L2=1, M2=2, N2=3, O2=4, P2=5, Q2=6, R2=7\n\nSo Q24 will be 1/(1+0.08)^6 and R25 will use that.\n\nLet me recalculate:\nNow I have the expected values. Let me verify my update script is correct and save the final file:\nNow let me verify the final values by checking the formulas in the saved file:\nThe file was moved. Let me recreate it:\nThe file has been updated and exported. Now let me provide the JSON summary with the calculated values:\n\n{\"reasoning_steps\": \"1.

Updated growth rate formulas K5, K7, K11, K17 to calculate from 2023 (column J) to 2024 (column K). 4. Changed L2 from formula =K2+1 to hardcoded value 1, making 2025 the first projection year for DCF discounting. 5. Removed K24 and K25 (PV calculations) since FY2024 is now historical, not a projection year. 6.
