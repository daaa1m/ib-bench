However, there are notable edge cases: Solina Group is at the very top end of the revenue range and is more of a food solutions/seasonings platform than a pure ingredients play; Indena\u2019s core business skews toward pharma/nutraceutical actives rather than mainstream food ingredients. These issues weaken overall fit for an M&A origination screen."
