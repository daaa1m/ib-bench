However, it remains high-level and lacks specific metrics or concrete comparisons cited in the deck."

While the margin-of-safety logic is directionally sound, it fails to specify an explicit entry multiple or valuation range, despite this being a core requirement. An IC would expect concrete numbers tied to the deck\u2019s valuation analysis."
