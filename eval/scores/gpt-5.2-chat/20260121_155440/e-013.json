      "details": "Score: 0.82 - The questions are generally specific, commercially relevant, and framed in a way that management could answer with actionable detail. They are well anchored to current operating issues (shrink, SG&A pressure, remodel ROI, pricing competition, low-income consumer exposure). However, a few questions lean on asserted facts (e.g., magnitude of margin expansion, delivery availability across most stores) without tight numerical grounding, and some could be sharpened further by explicitly asking for quantified ranges or timeframes."

However, private label strategy and distribution/logistics are only indirectly referenced, and 'damages' is not explicitly addressed beyond shrink. Coverage is adequate but not fully complete relative to the stated required topics."

That said, reliance on secondary aggregators (Motley Fool, GuruFocus, MSN) rather than primary transcripts or filings reduces rigor, and some cited links appear loosely matched to the specific claims embedded in the questions."

      "details": "Score: 0.60 - The methodology description is high-level and generic. It explains that earnings calls and industry commentary were reviewed, but does not clearly articulate how issues were screened, weighted, or prioritized, nor why these ten questions rose above others. This meets minimum expectations but lacks depth."
