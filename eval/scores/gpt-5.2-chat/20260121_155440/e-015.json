However, several market cap figures appear materially inaccurate or at least not clearly anchored to January 1, 2026 values (e.g., Sarepta, Madrigal), and the 30\u201350% probability framing is asserted without deal-specific justification. Usable with corrections, but not yet client-ready."

      "actual": "0.75",
      "details": "Score: 0.75 - Tier 2 targets are plausible and internally consistent, with a reasonable mix of platform-driven and valuation-driven candidates. Strategic rationales are directionally sound, but again market cap precision is questionable and the probability ranges feel generic rather than analytically derived. Solid foundation, but requires fact-checking and sharper differentiation versus Tier 1."
