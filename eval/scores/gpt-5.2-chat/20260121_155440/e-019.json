Main risk is numerical fidelity\u2014given AMC\u2019s complexity, several thresholds and basket interactions would need spot-checking against the document before client use."

However, some elements (e.g., IPO-related equity dividend mechanics) appear questionable for AMC and raise concerns about over-generalization or misattribution. Usable, but requires careful scrub."
