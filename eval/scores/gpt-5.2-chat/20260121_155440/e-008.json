Themes reflect management\u2019s core narrative and strategic priorities, though one additional theme (e.g., pricing strategy/regulatory credits) could have strengthened completeness."

Captures directional outlook rather than specific guidance, which is consistent with Tesla\u2019s MD&A, but could benefit from clearer linkage to stated management tone (e.g., near-term pressure vs. long-term opportunity)."
