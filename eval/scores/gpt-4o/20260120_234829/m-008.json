      "details": "Score: 0.50 - Clear but extremely generic. Does not state a concrete, conviction-backed recommendation or summarize the activist\u2019s specific plan or valuation logic. Reads like a placeholder rather than an IC-ready executive summary."

      "details": "Score: 0.45 - Overly narrow and partially inaccurate. The activist deck emphasizes portfolio complexity, structural margin under-earning, and conglomerate discount issues, not just North American beverage bottling inefficiency. Lacks financial context and specificity from the deck."
