Several highly material Coinbase-specific S-1 risks (e.g., revenue concentration in transaction fees, dependence on retail trading volumes, regulatory classification of crypto assets as securities, reliance on third\u2011party banking partners) are missing. Implications are boilerplate and not clearly grounded in the S\u20111."
