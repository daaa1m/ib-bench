      "details": "Score: 0.45 - Questions are largely generic, high-level, and could apply to almost any discount retailer. They are not clearly grounded in Dollar General\u2013specific disclosures or current pain points (e.g., recent shrink commentary, store labor model resets, private label mix, or distribution constraints). Several questions combine multiple topics without precision, limiting actionability. As written, these would not materially advance management diligence."

      "details": "Score: 0.55 - While most headline topics are nominally mentioned, coverage is superficial and incomplete. Key required areas such as private label economics, distribution network constraints, and concrete media network monetization are either missing or only vaguely referenced. Some topics (e.g., SNAP exposure, digital delivery) are framed imprecisely or in a way that suggests limited understanding of the operating model."

      "details": "Score: 0.30 - Sources are weakly used and in some cases likely incorrect or fabricated (e.g., references to Q1 2026 earnings calls that may not exist as of January 21, 2026). There is no clear linkage between specific disclosures in the cited sources and the questions asked. Reliance on generic aggregator sites rather than primary sources (10-K, earnings transcripts, investor presentations) is below professional standards."

      "details": "Score: 0.50 - Methodology is described at a very high level and does not demonstrate a rigorous process. There is no indication of how specific issues were identified from the sources, how questions were prioritized, or how Dollar General\u2019s recent performance and strategic shifts informed the diligence focus. Acceptable as a placeholder, but not robust."
