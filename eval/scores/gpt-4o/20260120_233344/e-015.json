      "details": "Score: 0.30 - Tier 1 contains multiple fundamental errors. Seagen was acquired by Pfizer in December 2023 and cannot be an M&A target as of January 1, 2026. Vertex and Regeneron are mega-cap, independent biopharma companies with entrenched business models and governance structures; assigning them 30\u201350% takeout probabilities is not credible. Overall target selection shows weak judgment of what constitutes a plausible U.S. biotech M&A target."

      "details": "Score: 0.50 - Tier 2 includes generally plausible biotech names, but still suffers from analytical weaknesses. Moderna\u2019s inclusion lacks context around strategic resistance to acquisition and post-COVID valuation volatility. Royalty Pharma is not a traditional biotech operating company, making its inclusion questionable. Probabilities appear arbitrary and unsupported."

It does not address key M&A drivers such as pipeline maturity, loss-of-exclusivity risk, balance sheet constraints, antitrust considerations, or buyer universe. Tiering logic is overly simplistic and not defensible at a senior or client level."
