      "details": "Score: 0.85 - The reasoning steps demonstrate a solid, methodical approach to the task. Step 1 shows proper extraction of key figures from the 10-Q with specific values cited (MIS $1,098M, MA $909M, total revenue $2,007M, balance sheet items, etc.). Step 2 demonstrates understanding of the model structure by mapping figures to specific locations and noting the use of formulas vs hardcodes. Step 3 shows appropriate validation with specific tie-out checks (revenue consistency across sheets, balance sheet equation verification). The analyst also noted formatting conventions (blue for hardcodes, green for cross-references), which shows attention to model standards. However, the reasoning could be slightly more detailed on how certain derived items were calculated (e.g., the specific methodology for net income of $685.32M) and whether any adjustments or reconciliations were needed between GAAP figures in the 10-Q and the model's presentation. The work is professional quality and demonstrates the analyst understood the task requirements and executed systematically with proper validation."
