The original formula (Current NWC - Prior NWC) produced a positive value when NWC increased, incorrectly showing a source of cash instead of a use. The corrected formula (Prior NWC - Current NWC) produces a negative value when NWC increases, correctly reflecting the cash outflow. This error caused a cumulative balance sheet discrepancy equal to 2x the change in NWC each period, which compounded through the forecast.",
