      "details": "Score: 0.85 - The 10 questions are highly specific, actionable, and grounded in Dollar General's current operational challenges. Each question probes for quantifiable metrics (e.g., 'what is the timeline and capital required,' 'quantify the fully-loaded cost,' 'what is the current revenue run rate') rather than accepting qualitative narratives. The questions demonstrate strong understanding of retail economics and would elicit decision-useful information. The 'why it matters' sections effectively link each question to valuation drivers. Minor deduction: Q8 on perishable shrink could be more specific about the data request (e.g., asking for shrink rates by category and store format), and Q9 on self-checkout could probe deeper into the cost-benefit analysis with specific metrics. Overall, this is solid work that would be ready for senior review with minimal edits."

      "details": "Score: 0.90 - All seven required topics are comprehensively addressed with appropriate depth. Margins/shrink covered in Q1 and Q8; SG&A/labor/turnover in Q2 and Q9; inventory/SKU in Q4; store productivity in Q5 and Q10; pricing/competition in Q6; digital/delivery in Q7; low-income consumer/SNAP in Q3. The analyst went beyond mechanical coverage by ensuring questions within each topic probe different angles (e.g., shrink from theft vs. perishable waste; labor turnover costs vs. self-checkout trade-offs). The distribution is balanced and reflects appropriate prioritization based on materiality. This exceeds basic requirements."

Sources are appropriately matched to questions. However, there are concerns about verifiability: several sources are URLs that cannot be independently verified without web access, and some specific claims (e.g., '3.3% shrink in FY2023,' '1,000 SKU reduction') would benefit from more precise citations (page numbers, specific transcript quotes). The sourcing is adequate for diligence prep but would need validation before client presentation. A competent effort that meets professional standards but has room for improvement in precision."

      "details": "Score: 0.85 - The methodology section clearly articulates a logical, three-part prioritization framework: (1) materiality to near-term earnings, (2) alignment with management's stated priorities, and (3) ability to elicit quantifiable responses. The reasoning steps provide a clear audit trail from research to question development. The analyst demonstrates appropriate judgment in ranking shrink and labor highest given their EBITDA impact. The approach is sound and replicable. Minor improvement opportunity: could have been more explicit about how competing priorities were balanced (e.g., why DG Fresh ranked #10 despite being a 'structural cost advantage') and could have noted any topics considered but excluded. Overall, this is transparent, professional work."
