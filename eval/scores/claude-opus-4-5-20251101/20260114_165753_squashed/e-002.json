Key figures verified: 45 PE-sponsored companies taken over (correct), subprime auto delinquencies at 6.65% (correct), consumer loan delinquencies at 4.48% (correct, though article says 4.5% rounded), FTI Q3 revenue growth 18.6% in corp finance (correct), 41% EPS growth to $2.60 (correct), $846 million buybacks (correct, though article says $846.1M), 14.1% share reduction (correct), 0.8x net debt/EBITDA (correct), reserves at $3.1 trillion from $4.2 trillion (correct), Polymarket odds at 76% (correct), $3-4 trillion tariff revenue estimate (article mentions $3.3T + $0.7T = $4T combined, so range is reasonable), 19% GDP figure for entitlements (correct). Minor issue: article says 'more than double the 2024 pace' for PE takeovers, not explicitly 'fastest rate in at least six years' though Lincoln International is cited correctly. The 90% LME failure rate is attributed to 'industry sources' but not directly quoted in the article - this is the main accuracy concern as it appears to be analyst inference rather than explicit article content."

      "details": "Score: 0.75 - Summary captures major themes: restructuring cycle, FTI thesis, monetary policy, fiscal concerns, and tariff case. However, several material points from the article are omitted: (1) The CPI methodology discussion and inflation measurement issues (significant section), (2) Consumer sentiment data (U of Michigan index at 50.3), (3) McDonald's example of bifurcated consumer spending, (4) The three Southeast Asian equity ideas (Sampoerna, Puregold, Philippine Seven) which constitute a substantial portion of the article, (5) Specific details on Fed's standing repo facility and Williams urging dealers to use it, (6) The vape crackdown impact on Seven Corp, (7) Health insurance premium increases (26% for ACA, 114% without subsidies). The reasoning section mentions Southeast Asian equities but the summary completely omits them. For a senior banker, the Asian equity ideas might be less relevant than restructuring/M&A content, but omitting them entirely when they represent ~15-20% of article content is a completeness gap."

Structure is logical with three clear sections: credit cycle/restructuring data, FTI thesis, and macro backdrop. No significant filler or redundancy. The phrase 'liability management exercises\u2014which industry sources estimate fail 90% of the time\u2014come back for second attempts' is slightly awkward but not verbose. Could potentially trim some detail on FTI's divisional headwinds (Orszag departure) as less critical for deal activity focus, but overall the length is justified given the breadth of content covered."

      "details": "Score: 0.90 - Excellent prioritization for a senior banker focused on deal activity. Leads with the most actionable content: accelerating restructuring cycle with hard data (45 PE takeovers, delinquency rates). FTI thesis is highly relevant as a proxy for restructuring advisory demand and includes specific valuation metrics (17.1x vs 24x historical). Macro section appropriately frames market conditions affecting financing and deals. The reasoning explicitly acknowledges prioritizing 'restructuring cycle narrative and FTI thesis as most actionable for deal activity.' Appropriately de-emphasizes or omits less deal-relevant content like CPI methodology debates and consumer retail examples. Only minor deduction: could have been even more explicit about implications for M&A/financing conditions."

      "details": "Score: 0.80 - The reasoning section provides clear editorial judgment about what's 'most deal-relevant' and explains prioritization logic, which is appropriate and helpful. However, the summary itself blends facts with light interpretation without always clearly distinguishing them. For example, 'accelerating credit cycle inflection point' is interpretive framing, and 'Goldilocks environment' language isn't directly from the article. The phrase 'liability management exercises...come back for second attempts' interprets the 'pig in a python' metaphor. These interpretations are reasonable and add value, but could be more clearly flagged as analytical overlay versus article content. The reasoning section is strong, but the summary could better separate 'what the article says' from 'what this means.'"

Figures are presented with appropriate precision and context. Structure flows logically from market data to specific investment thesis to macro backdrop. Avoids hedging language and editorializing. The phrase 'seized control' is slightly informal but acceptable. 'Goldilocks environment' quote from analyst is properly attributed. No grammatical errors. Tone is appropriately serious and fact-focused. Very minor deduction: could use more explicit transition phrases between the three main sections to enhance readability for a time-pressed senior banker."
