No year-by-year forecast for 2021-2024, no segment-level projections despite input data having four segments (AMS Europe, ECS Europe, Americas & Asia, Others), no cost structure breakdown, and no margin analysis. The implied 6.6% revenue CAGR and 13.6% 2025 EBITDA margin are plausible but cannot be verified. Major deficiency - attempted but completely insufficient."

No debt structure details, no transaction fees, no financing breakdown, no EV-to-Equity bridge shown. Cannot determine leverage multiple or debt/equity split.

However, these cannot be verified without seeing the underlying model, cash flow assumptions, debt paydown schedule, or exit calculation. The entry equity value of \u20ac138.5m appears understated by ~\u20ac30m, which would significantly impact returns if corrected. Numbers are in a reasonable range for PE deals but lack any supporting detail or verification. Meets absolute minimum threshold as a starting point only."
