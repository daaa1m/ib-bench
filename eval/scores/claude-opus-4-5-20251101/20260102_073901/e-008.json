Themes are substantive, well-supported with data, and reflect the core MD&A content. Minor deduction for slight overlap between themes 4 and 5 regarding competitive pressures."

Includes specific figures like 473,382 delivery increase and 14.72 GWh energy deployed. Captures competitive dynamics and the trade-off between volume and pricing. Minor deduction for not explicitly mentioning some granular cost reduction initiatives that may be detailed in MD&A."

Captures management's self-funding expectation and delivery timing optimization goal. Slightly lacks detail on specific production capacity targets or timeline specifics for next-gen platform if provided in MD&A."

Well-organized and comprehensive. Minor deduction as some risks may be more from Risk Factors section than MD&A emphasis, and could have prioritized the most MD&A-emphasized risks more clearly."
