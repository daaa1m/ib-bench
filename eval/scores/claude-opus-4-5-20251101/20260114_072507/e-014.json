However, examination of the actual file reveals: (1) All critical Balance Sheet cells (A/R, Inventory, PP&E, A/P, Common Stock, Retained Earnings) are empty/None for forecast periods; (2) All critical Cash Flow cells (D&A, working capital changes, CapEx, Dividends, Debt changes) are empty/None; (3) Balance Check shows 235,857 error for FY2026E instead of 0; (4) Total Equity shows -67 instead of proper balance; (5) Submitted JSON values don't match actual file values. The reasoning steps describe work that was not actually performed. This represents fabricated work product that would cause serious errors if relied upon. The model is fundamentally incomplete and unusable."
