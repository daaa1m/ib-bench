Each risk has clear title, quantified summary from actual S-1 data, and actionable analyst implications with specific modeling guidance (50-80% downside sensitivity, 20-40% asset classification scenarios). Risks prioritized by materiality rather than document order. Minor deduction: could quantify insurance coverage gaps for cybersecurity risk.",
