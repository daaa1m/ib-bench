Key verified facts: 45 PE-sponsored companies taken over by creditors in first 9 months (confirmed), Lincoln International source (confirmed), subprime auto delinquencies at 6.65% in October and highest since Fitch began tracking in 1994 (confirmed), overall consumer loan delinquencies at 4.48% Q3 2025 and highest since Q1 2020 (confirmed), FTI FCN ticker and 17.1x 2026E earnings vs 5-year average of 24x (confirmed), Q3 18.6% restructuring revenue growth and 41% EPS growth to $2.60 (confirmed), Jonathan Orszag departure (confirmed), $846M stock buyback and 14.1% share reduction (confirmed), 0.8x net debt/EBITDA (confirmed), reserves at $3.1T from $4.2T (confirmed), QT ending Dec 1 (confirmed), Supreme Court Polymarket odds 76% (confirmed), Social Security/Medicare/interest/defense consuming 19% of GDP vs 23% total spending (confirmed), Faulkender quotes and failed auction comment (confirmed). Minor issue: article says 'highest since Fitch began tracking in 1994' for subprime auto, but summary could be more precise that this refers to 60+ day delinquencies specifically."

      "details": "Score: 0.85 - The summary captures the major themes comprehensively: restructuring cycle acceleration, FTI Consulting investment thesis with detailed financials and management actions, Federal Reserve monetary policy transition, tariff Supreme Court case with fiscal implications, and fiscal sustainability concerns. Material details included: specific delinquency statistics, FTI's business challenges (Orszag departure, LME dynamics), CEO Gunby's first open-market purchase since 2017, repo market stress signals, Michael Faulkender's fiscal analysis, and entitlement math. Missing elements that reduce score: CPI methodology issues and health insurance premium surge (only briefly mentioned in reasoning, not summary), the 90% LME failure rate context (mentioned but could be clearer), the three Southeast Asian equity ideas (Sampoerna, Puregold, Seven Corp.) are noted in reasoning but completely absent from summary despite being substantial article content. Given the article's multi-topic structure, the omission of the Asian equity section is a notable gap."

      "actual": "0.75",
      "details": "Score: 0.75 - The summary is substantive but contains some inefficiencies. At approximately 330 words for the summary section, it's appropriate for the 13-page source document with multiple distinct articles. However, there are areas of mild redundancy: the restructuring cycle is introduced with the 45 company statistic, then the delinquency data is presented, then it circles back to 'accelerating credit cycle inflection point' - this could be tighter. The phrase 'despite headwinds in its economic consulting division following the departure of Compass Lexecon co-founder Jonathan Orszag' is somewhat wordy. The Faulkender section, while important, takes up significant space with the 19% vs 23% calculation that could be stated more efficiently. The reasoning section at 145 words is appropriate for explaining prioritization decisions. Some phrases like 'direct M&A/restructuring relevance' and 'most deal-relevant content centers on' add modest filler. Overall, the summary is professional and readable but could be 10-15% tighter without losing substance."

      "details": "Score: 0.88 - The summary leads with highly relevant content for senior bankers: 'Grant's Interest Rate Observer identifies an accelerating credit cycle inflection point with direct implications for restructuring advisory demand.' This immediately signals deal relevance. The 45 PE company takeovers and delinquency statistics provide concrete evidence of the cycle turn. The FTI Consulting thesis follows logically as the actionable investment idea tied to this theme, with appropriate emphasis on valuation (17.1x vs 24x historical), recent results, and capital allocation. The monetary policy section provides essential market context (reserves, QT ending, repo stress). The tariff Supreme Court case connects to fiscal policy and revenue implications. The Faulkender fiscal sustainability discussion is relevant for understanding long-term macro constraints. However, the summary could be more tightly focused on deal implications throughout - for example, the connection between monetary policy and financing conditions could be more explicit. The reasoning section appropriately identifies FTI and LME cycle as 'most actionable for deal activity' while noting macro provides 'important context.' The 76% Polymarket odds and $3-4T tariff revenue impact are relevant for policy scenario planning."

      "actual": "0.82",
      "details": "Score: 0.82 - The reasoning section provides clear, relevant commentary that is well-distinguished from article facts. It explains the evaluation framework: 'For a senior banker, the most deal-relevant content centers on: the FTI Consulting restructuring advisory opportunity (direct M&A/restructuring relevance), the liability management exercise (LME) cycle creating advisory demand, monetary policy signals suggesting QE resumption may be approaching, and the tariff Supreme Court case with its fiscal implications.' This prioritization is insightful and appropriate for the audience. The commentary notes the article contains 'multiple distinct articles' and makes an explicit choice to prioritize 'restructuring cycle narrative and FTI thesis as most actionable for deal activity, while the monetary/fiscal backdrop provides important context.' This is sound judgment. However, the commentary could be stronger by: (1) explicitly noting the omission of the Asian equity section and why (less relevant for IB work), (2) connecting dots between themes more clearly (e.g., how fiscal stress + monetary tightening + credit stress reinforce each other), (3) providing a forward-looking perspective on implications for M&A/financing environment. The commentary is professional and appropriate but somewhat descriptive rather than deeply analytical."

      "details": "Score: 0.95 - The tone is highly professional and appropriate for senior banker communication throughout. Language is precise and technical without being pedantic: 'liability management exercise (LME) cycle,' 'net debt/EBITDA,' '60+ days delinquent,' 'quantitative tightening.' The summary avoids casual language and maintains appropriate formality. Numbers are presented with appropriate precision (6.65%, 17.1x, $846 million, 14.1%, 0.8x). The structure is logical and easy to follow. Attribution is clear ('according to Lincoln International,' 'industry sources estimate,' 'Polymarket odds'). The opening sentence is strong: 'Grant's Interest Rate Observer identifies an accelerating credit cycle inflection point with direct implications for restructuring advisory demand.' Proper names and titles are used correctly (CEO Steven Gunby, Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender). The summary appropriately balances detail with readability. Very minor areas for improvement: the phrase 'come back for second attempts' in the LME context is slightly informal compared to 'require subsequent restructuring' or similar. The term 'manna from heaven' appears in the article but correctly is not used in the summary. Overall, the tone is exemplary for the target audience."
