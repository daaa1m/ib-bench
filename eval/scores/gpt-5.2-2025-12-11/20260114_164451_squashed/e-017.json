Deal values, dates, and payment structures appear accurate based on the sources cited. The transactions span multiple basins (Permian, San Juan, Vaca Muerta, Anadarko, Delaware, California, Marcellus, Utica, DJ Basin) and include both corporate acquisitions (Vital Energy, Berry Corp, Canvas Energy) and asset sales. Minor issues: some seller fields are blank for public company mergers (acceptable convention but could be more explicit), and the Verdad transaction lists 'Stock' as payment type when the source indicates 'all-equity transaction' involving membership interests (technically correct but could be clearer). The work demonstrates solid research and appropriate transaction selection. Would be comfortable presenting this to senior bankers with minimal edits."
