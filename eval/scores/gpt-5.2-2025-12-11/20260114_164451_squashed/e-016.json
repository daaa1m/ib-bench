      "details": "Score: 0.75 - Analyst correctly stated the exchange ratio (1.436 shares) and appropriately noted that no fixed cash price or implied equity value is stated in the provided excerpt. This is accurate - the 8-K does not provide an implied equity value. However, a more proactive analyst might have noted that implied value could be calculated from market prices at announcement, though this wasn't explicitly asked. The response is accurate but somewhat passive."

This is accurate - the 8-K references the full merger agreement as Exhibit 2.1 but notes schedules/exhibits were omitted. The analyst appropriately did not speculate. However, a more thorough analyst might have noted that the full merger agreement would contain these provisions and flagged this as a gap requiring follow-up."

Appropriately acknowledged limitations of the source document (no MAE definition, no implied equity value). The reasoning steps show logical progression through the document. Professional approach of not speculating beyond what the document provides."
