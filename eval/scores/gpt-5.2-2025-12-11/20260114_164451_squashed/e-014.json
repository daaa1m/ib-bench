      "details": "Score: 0.85 - The reasoning steps demonstrate a solid understanding of 3-statement modeling mechanics. Step 1 correctly describes Balance Sheet drivers (working capital days, PP&E roll-forward, retained earnings). Step 2 accurately outlines Cash Flow construction including proper sign conventions for working capital changes and the debt financing plug. Step 3 shows appropriate validation checks. The description is clear, methodical, and covers the key linkages. Minor deduction: could have been more explicit about the circular reference handling (if any) and the specific treatment of the cash plug/financing mechanics, but overall this reflects competent technical understanding that meets professional standards."
