Cannot verify the '12% CAGR Americas & Asia' claim in thesis. Overall 5.4% CAGR is reasonable but conservative. EBITDA margin held flat at 11.2% is simplistic. Without the actual model showing segment detail, cost structure, and build-up, this fails professional standards."

However, these returns require \u20ac80m debt paydown which appears aggressive based on FCF analysis (\u20ac62m more realistic). Returns likely overstated by 10-15%. Exit at 8.0x same as entry is reasonable. Numbers are in plausible range but lack supporting cash flow detail. Meets minimum threshold only because math is internally consistent, but cannot verify underlying assumptions."
