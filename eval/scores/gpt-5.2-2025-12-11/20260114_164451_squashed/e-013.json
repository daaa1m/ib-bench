Each question demonstrates strong understanding of retail fundamentals (shrink, SG&A deleverage, SKU rationalization, unit economics). The questions appropriately push for quantifiable metrics, leading indicators, and time-bound proof points\u2014exactly what senior bankers need in diligence. Minor weakness: without access to actual source documents, I cannot verify whether these issues are truly grounded in recent earnings/transcripts or are generic retail questions. The questions themselves are investment-grade quality."

However, the rubric specifically mentions 'media network' and 'private label' as required topics under margins/distribution, and these are not explicitly addressed. This is a notable gap given the specificity of the requirement. The analyst covered breadth well but missed two specific sub-topics."

The analyst cites only 'https://investor.dollargeneral.com/' for all 10 questions\u2014a generic homepage URL, not specific earnings releases, transcripts, or investor presentations. There are no dates, no specific quotes, no transcript references, no page numbers from presentations. The task explicitly required grounding questions in 'earnings releases, investor presentations, transcripts, and credible industry commentary.' A professional diligence memo would cite specific sources (e.g., 'Q3 2024 earnings call, Oct 2024' or 'FY2024 Investor Day presentation, slide 12'). This would not meet standards for client-facing work."

      "details": "Score: 0.70 - The methodology section explains a reasonable approach: reviewed investor materials, identified recurring themes, prioritized by EPS impact and controllability. The reasoning steps show logical sequencing. However, the explanation is somewhat generic and lacks specificity about which materials were reviewed, what time period, or how prioritization trade-offs were made. A stronger methodology would explain: 'Reviewed Q1-Q3 2024 earnings calls and identified shrink mentioned 15+ times vs. 3 mentions in 2023' or 'Prioritized margin questions over growth questions given 200bps gross margin compression YoY.' The framework is sound but execution lacks the rigor expected for institutional-quality work."
