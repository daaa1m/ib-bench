      "details": "Score: 0.70 - Provides exactly five risks with clear titles, summaries, and implications, and the prioritization is broadly sensible. However, the risks are highly generic and read like an industry template rather than a Coinbase S-1\u2013specific analysis. Key Coinbase-specific risks disclosed in the S-1 (e.g., reliance on retail trading volumes, regulatory status of specific assets, dependence on a small number of revenue drivers or customer cohorts, litigation exposure, or conflicts with regulators) are not clearly reflected, which reduces materiality precision."

      "details": "Score: 0.65 - The rationale explains the general logic for ranking (probability and impact) and correctly elevates regulatory risk. However, it lacks concrete linkage to disclosures in the Coinbase S-1 and does not clearly explain why these risks were chosen over other highly material risks actually emphasized in the filing. The explanation remains high-level and could apply to nearly any crypto exchange."

      "details": "Score: 0.75 - The methodology is coherent, structured, and professionally stated, and it aligns with how an analyst should approach an S-1 review. That said, it is generic and not evidentially tied to the actual document (no indication of weighting, cross-referencing, or validation against Coinbase-specific risk language), limiting confidence that the process was truly executed as described."
