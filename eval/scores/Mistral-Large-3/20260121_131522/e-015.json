Overall solid but not yet MD-ready without fact-checking."

      "details": "Score: 0.65 - Generally reasonable targets and rationales, but inclusion of a private company with no market cap estimate conflicts with the task instructions, and multiple market cap figures are likely inaccurate. Risk differentiation versus Tier 1 is directionally right but underdeveloped."
