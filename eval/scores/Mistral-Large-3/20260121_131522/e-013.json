      "details": "Score: 0.72 - The questions are generally well-framed, specific, and directionally relevant to Dollar General\u2019s current operating issues. Several questions (e.g., shrink, SG&A, SKU rationalization, labor ROI) reflect appropriate management-diligence depth. However, there are material weaknesses: some numeric claims (e.g., 90 bps gross margin expansion in fiscal 2025, SG&A up 11.1% in 2025) are asserted without clear confirmation they are accurate or properly contextualized (fiscal vs. calendar year, full-year vs. partial). A few questions are also generic (e.g., store productivity KPIs) and would benefit from sharper linkage to recent disclosed metrics or initiatives. Overall usable, but would require VP-level cleanup before senior circulation."

However, coverage is uneven: private label and distribution are not explicitly addressed, and the media network topic is only lightly probed relative to its stated importance. The analyst\u2019s claim that 'all required topics are covered' overstates completeness."

There is limited use of primary sources such as Dollar General earnings transcripts, investor presentations, or SEC filings, which were explicitly called for in the task. Some sources appear tangential and may not directly substantiate the specific numeric assertions embedded in the questions."
