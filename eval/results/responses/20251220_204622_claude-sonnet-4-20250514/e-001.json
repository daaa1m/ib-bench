  "raw_response": "I'll help you diagnose and fix the LBO model balance sheet issue. Let me start by examining the uploaded Excel file to understand the structure and identify the imbalance.\nI see that row 140 contains \"Cash from Investing\" which suggests this is in the Cash Flow Statement section, not the Balance Sheet check. Let me find the actual Balance Sheet check and examine the model structure more thoroughly.\nGreat! I found the Balance Sheet check in row 123. Let me examine the Balance Sheet section more thoroughly to understand the structure and identify the imbalance.\nPerfect! Now I can see the issue. The Balance Sheet is unbalanced starting from column L (first projection year), and the imbalance is growing each year, which suggests it's a Cash Flow Statement issue. The imbalance starts in the first projection year at approximately $33.9M.\n\nLet me examine the Cash Flow Statement more thoroughly and check the cash calculation since this is typically where such issues arise.\nExcellent! I found the issue. Looking at the Cash Flow Statement analysis, I can see that:\n\n1. The Free Cash Flow is being calculated correctly\n2. The Beginning Cash is correct at $15M (minimum cash balance)\n3. However, the Ending Cash is stuck at $15M instead of flowing through properly\n\nThe issue appears to be in Row 140 - \"Cash from Investing\". Let me examine this more closely:\nPerfect! I've identified the exact error. The issue is in Row 140 \"Cash from Investing\" - it should sum both Maintenance Capex (row 138) and Growth Capex (row 139), but it's currently only referencing Growth Capex (row 139).\n\nLet me now create the corrected Excel file:\nNow let me provide the final JSON analysis:\n\n{\n  \"error_location\": \"Row 140 (Cash from Investing), Columns L through P\",\n  \"current_formula\": \"=L139\",\n  \"corrected_formula\": \"=L138+L139\",\n  \"logical_explanation\": \"The Cash from Investing line item was only summing Growth Capex (row 139) but missing Maintenance Capex (row 138). In an LBO model, both maintenance and growth capex represent cash outflows for investing activities and must be included in the Cash Flow Statement. The missing maintenance capex created an artificial increase in cash flow, leading to the Balance Sheet imbalance as assets were not properly funded by corresponding cash outflows.\",\n  \"audit_steps_followed\": [\"Circularity Control - Identified this as a static linkage error rather than iterative loop issue\", \"Variance Analysis - Found the Break Year in column L (first projection year) with imbalance of $33.9M\", \"Evaluated Error Behavior - The growing variance suggested a Cash Flow Statement flow issue\", \"Linkage Integrity - Verified summation ranges and found missing maintenance capex in Cash from Investing calculation\", \"Applied Golden Rule - Confirmed that the missing capex outflow violated the principle that every Balance Sheet change must be reflected in Cash Flow Statement\"]\n}\n",
