The publication contains multiple distinct articles covering: (1) Federal Reserve monetary policy and money market stress, (2) tariff policy uncertainty and Supreme Court case, (3) fiscal sustainability concerns (entitlements, demographics), (4) CPI methodology and inflation measurement issues, (5) consumer credit delinquencies and market sentiment, (6) a bullish investment thesis on FTI Consulting, and (7) three Southeast Asian equity ideas. For a senior banker, the most deal-relevant content centers on: the FTI Consulting restructuring advisory opportunity (direct M&A/restructuring relevance), the liability management exercise (LME) cycle creating advisory demand, monetary policy signals suggesting QE resumption may be approaching, and the tariff Supreme Court case with its fiscal implications. I prioritized the restructuring cycle narrative and FTI thesis as most actionable for deal activity, while the monetary/fiscal backdrop provides important context for market conditions affecting financing and valuations.\", \"summary\": \"Grant's Interest Rate Observer identifies an accelerating credit cycle inflection point with direct implications for restructuring advisory demand. Creditors have seized control of 45 private equity-sponsored companies in the first nine months of 2025, more than double the 2024 pace and the fastest rate in at least six years, according to Lincoln International. Subprime auto loan delinquencies (60+ days) reached 6.65% in October, the highest since Fitch began tracking in 1994, while overall consumer loan delinquencies hit 4.48%, the highest since Q1 2020.\\n\\nThe publication presents a bullish thesis on FTI Consulting (FCN), one of the largest restructuring advisory firms globally, trading at 17.1x 2026E earnings versus a five-year average of 24x. The firm posted record Q3 results with 18.6% revenue growth in corporate finance and restructuring and 41% EPS growth to $2.60, despite headwinds in its economic consulting division following the departure of Compass Lexecon co-founder Jonathan Orszag. FTI has repurchased $846 million of stock year-to-date, reducing shares outstanding by 14.1%, and CEO Steven Gunby made his first open-market purchase since 2017. The balance sheet shows 0.8x net debt/EBITDA. The restructuring pipeline is expected to grow as liability management exercises\u2014which industry sources estimate fail 90% of the time\u2014come back for second attempts.\\n\\nOn the macro front, the Federal Reserve is signaling an end to quantitative tightening by December 1 and potential balance-sheet expansion thereafter, with repo rates showing stress reminiscent of late 2018-2019. System-wide bank reserves have declined to $3.1 trillion from $4.2 trillion four years ago. Federal regulators are preparing to relax capital requirements to enable banks to warehouse more government securities. A Supreme Court ruling on tariff authority appears likely to go against the administration (Polymarket odds at 76%), which would eliminate up to $3-4 trillion in projected tariff revenues over the next decade and force a restructuring of trade policy. Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender warned that a failed Treasury auction may ultimately be required to force Congressional action on entitlement spending, noting that Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, interest expense, and defense alone will consume 19% of GDP against total federal spending of 23%.\"}\n",
