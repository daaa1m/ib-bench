  title: "Add interest circularity to LBO model"
  type: fix-error
  category:
    - financial-analysis
  input_type: excel
  description:
    "LLM is provided an LBO model without interest circularity. LLM must add
    circularity by calculating interest from average of beginning and ending
    debt balance with a circularity switch. Correctness verified by checking
    row 164 (Total Cash Interest) values with circ ON: K164=-112, L164=-102,
    M164=-98, N164=-92, O164=-84. Tests LLM's ability to implement circular
    references in Excel."

prompt:
  notes: "LLM given background on circularity. Scoring checks output values, not formula structure."

input:
  input-file-original: "$human/MRW-LBO-Model-No-Circ.xlsx"
  notes: "Model intentionally lacks circularity in interest calculation"
