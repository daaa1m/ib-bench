  title: "Extract and populate ADT management guidance history"
  type: extraction
  category:
    - data-extraction
    - financial-analysis
  input_type: multi
  description: >
    Extract ADT Inc.'s historical management guidance from public earnings
    releases and populate an Excel template. The task covers guidance for Total
    Revenue, Adj. EBITDA, Adj. EPS, and FCF before special items across
    quarterly earnings events from 2018 to 2025. Tests the ability to correctly
    map guidance to the appropriate fiscal year period (not the quarter when
    guidance was issued) and handle metrics that were introduced at different
    times (e.g., FCF guidance started in 2024, EPS guidance started in 2022).

prompt:
  notes: >
    LLM must search for ADT earnings releases, extract guidance figures, and
    correctly associate each guidance with the fiscal year being guided for (not
    the quarter when it was announced). Requires reasoning about which guidance
    applies to which period.

input:
  input-file-original: null
  notes: >
    LLM must fetch guidance data from web sources (SEC filings, investor
    relations, earnings releases). The input.xlsx provides the template
    structure with dates, events, and guidance periods already filled in - LLM
    only needs to fill the Low/High values for each metric.
