    Review an activist investor presentation on PepsiCo and produce an IC-ready

    and proposed initiatives, (3) the value creation opportunity and valuation
    implications, and (4) key risks. The output must include a clear

  notes: >
    The only permitted source is Elliott’s "Perspectives on PepsiCo"
    presentation hosted at
    https://elliottletters.com/wp-content/uploads/Elliotts-Perspectives-on-PepsiCo-Presentation.pdf.
    The LLM must NOT use any other sources. Rubric is purely LLM-judged and
    emphasizes professional presentation quality (structure, clarity,
    specificity, and actionability) plus valuation recommendation and risks.
