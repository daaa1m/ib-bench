  title: "Update equity model with 3Q25 actuals (Moody's)"
  type: creating
  category:
    - financial-analysis
    - data-extraction
  input_type: multi
  description: >
    Update an existing equity research-style model that currently contains 3Q25E
    estimates so it reflects 3Q25 actual reported results from the provided 3Q25
    10-Q. The model updates are confined to the 3Q25 column in each statement:
    column BT in the Segments tab, column BO in the IS tab, and column BB in the
    BS & CFS tab. Tests the ability to extract the correct figures from a filing,
    map them into an existing model structure, preserve formulas and formatting,
    and ensure the model balances (e.g., Total Assets equals Total Liabilities +
    Equity).

prompt:
  notes: >
    The model is already built; only the 3Q25 column needs to be updated from
    estimates to actuals using the attached 3Q25 10-Q. The LLM must preserve the
    model structure, keep formulas intact where appropriate, apply IB formatting,
    and verify the balance sheet ties after the update.

    Task includes two attached inputs in the task folder:
    - input-1.xlsx: the equity model containing 3Q25E columns to update
    - input-2.pdf: the 3Q25 10-Q used as the source of actuals
