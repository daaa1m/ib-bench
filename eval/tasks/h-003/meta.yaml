    Given an activist investor presentation on Phillips 66, obtain FY24 10-K and
    FY25 Q1/Q2/Q3 financials, build a full 3-statement model, incorporate value
    creation drivers from the deck, run a returns analysis, and recommend whether

    and disciplined IC-style recommendation.

  notes: >
    input.pdf is Elliott’s Streamline 66 presentation. The model must incorporate
    the deck’s value-creation levers and be anchored to public filings (FY24 10-K,
    FY25 Q1/Q2/Q3 10-Qs). The rubric is human-judged with no programmatic checks.
