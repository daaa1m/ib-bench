  input_type: excel
  description: >
    Complete a management return analysis in an LBO model. Given exit multiple
    range of 15x-19x (0.5x increments) and FY26 exit, calculate exit equity
    values and determine when management earns sweet equity. Sweet equity
    hurdle is 200% - exit equity must be at least 3x entry equity for mgmt
    to earn their 5% sweet equity pot. Expected: sweet equity kicks in at 16x
    multiple where exit equity of $5,387m exceeds 3x entry of $5,362m.

  notes: >
    Model has LBO sheet with transaction structure and projections through
    FY26. Mgmt Return Analysis sheet has assumptions listed but calculations
    incomplete. LLM must build the sensitivity table and sweet equity logic.
