  title: "Find and fix multiple errors in an LBO model"
  type: fix-error
  category:
    - financial-analysis
  input_type: excel
  description: |
    Model contains 3 errors:
    1. OCF (row 64 in "BS & CFS" sheet) is missing "adjustment of finance costs, net"
    2. Cell K32 in "FS Calcs" sheet has a rogue -10 value that should not be there
    3. Row 70 in "BS & CFS" sheet is missing addition of PPE incl leases (row 66)
    
    Expected answer after all fixes: 2024E Long Term Debt (K29 in "BS & CFS" sheet) = 504.9
    
    Tests ability to systematically audit a financial model and identify multiple errors
    without being told how many exist.

  notes: |
    LLM is told there is "more than one error" but not the exact count.
    Must report all errors found with locations and fixes.
    Final validation is checking Long Term Debt equals expected value.
