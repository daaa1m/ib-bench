  "raw_response": "The analysis of the provided data reveals the following insights regarding the imbalance in the balance sheet:\n\n1. **Error Location**: The discrepancy appears in **Row 122**, labeled \"Check,\" which should be zero if the balance sheet is correctly balanced.\n\n2. **Current Formula Insight**:\n   - The \"Check\" row (Row 122) is calculated as `Total Assets - Total Liabilities - Shareholder Equity`. This should logically be zero.\n   - The imbalance starts appearing from **2022** (Column 11) onwards, indicating a potential issue in the linkage or calculation from this year.\n\n3. **Identified Issue**:\n   - The **Cash from Operations** (Row 135) minus **Cash from Investing** (Row 139) should equal the **Free Cash Flow** (Row 142), which then flows into the **Ending Cash** on the balance sheet.\n   - The **Ending Cash** (Row 149) in the Cash Flow Statement should link directly to the **Cash & Cash Equivalents** on the Balance Sheet. However, the **Cash & Cash Equivalents** line on the balance sheet is missing from the provided data, suggesting a linkage error.\n\n4. **Logical Explanation**:\n   - The imbalance arises because the **Ending Cash** from the Cash Flow Statement is not correctly linked to the **Cash & Cash Equivalents** line on the Balance Sheet. This results in the total assets not reflecting the actual cash position, causing the imbalance.\n\n5. **Corrected Formula**:\n   - Ensure that the **Ending Cash** (Row 149) in the Cash Flow Statement is directly linked to the **Cash & Cash Equivalents** line in the Balance Sheet (likely missing in Row ~100-107).\n\nHere is the JSON output summarizing the findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error_location\": \"Row 122, Column 11 (2022)\",\n  \"current_formula\": \"=Total Assets - Total Liabilities - Shareholder Equity\",\n  \"corrected_formula\": \"Ensure Ending Cash (CFS Row 149) links to Cash & Cash Equivalents (BS)\",\n  \"logical_explanation\": \"The Ending Cash from the Cash Flow Statement is not linked to the Cash & Cash Equivalents on the Balance Sheet, causing an imbalance as the cash position is not accurately reflected in Total Assets.\",\n  \"audit_steps_followed\": [\n    \"Identified the 'Break Year' where the imbalance first appears (2022).\",\n    \"Evaluated the summation of Total Assets and Total Liabilities & Equity.\",\n    \"Verified the linkage integrity between Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet.\",\n    \"Confirmed the 'Golden Rule' of reflecting every period-to-period change in non-cash assets and liabilities on the Cash Flow Statement.\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nThe analysis of the provided data reveals the following insights regarding the imbalance in the balance sheet:\n\n1. **Error Location**: The discrepancy appears in **Row 122**, labeled \"Check,\" which should be zero if the balance sheet is correctly balanced.\n\n2. **Current Formula Insight**:\n   - The \"Check\" row (Row 122) is calculated as `Total Assets - Total Liabilities - Shareholder Equity`.
