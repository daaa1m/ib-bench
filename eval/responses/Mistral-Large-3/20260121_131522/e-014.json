  "raw_response": "The initial exploration of the Excel workbook reveals the following structure:\n\n- **Income Statement**: Contains revenue and expense data for fiscal years 2025 to 2028.\n- **Balance Sheet**: Currently incomplete, with placeholders for assets, liabilities, and equity.\n- **Cash Flow**: Also incomplete, with sections for operating, investing, and financing activities.\n- **Assumptions**: Contains model drivers and assumptions for the forecast years.\n\n### Plan to Complete the Model\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Completion**:\n   - Use working capital relationships (e.g., accounts receivable, payable, inventory) based on assumptions.\n   - Link retained earnings to net income from the Income Statement.\n   - Ensure total assets equal total liabilities plus equity.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement Completion**:\n   - Calculate net cash from operations using net income and changes in working capital.\n   - Calculate net cash from investing and financing based on assumptions or historical trends.\n   - Ensure ending cash ties to the balance sheet.\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Confirm that ending cash on the Cash Flow statement matches the cash on the Balance Sheet.\n\nLet's proceed with implementing these steps in the Excel workbook using Python and open-source tools. I will start by completing the Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement.The 3-statement model has been completed with the necessary linkages and calculations. Here is the deliverable:\n\n### 1.
