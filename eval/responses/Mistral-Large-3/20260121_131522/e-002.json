It highlights FTI's leverage, earnings multiples, and the potential for increased restructuring mandates due to rising defaults and credit stress, particularly in leveraged middle-market enterprises (LMEs).\n\n  2. **Key Quantitative Data**:\n     - FTI's net debt: $364 million (0.8x trailing EBITDA as of Sept. 30, 2025).\n     - Net cash position in Sept. 2024: $386.3 million.\n     - FTI's P/E multiple: 17.1x (2026 earnings estimate), compared to a 5-year average of 24x.\n     - Market cap: $5 billion.\n     - Short interest: 4.2% of equity float.\n     - S&P 500 earnings growth: 14.7% YoY (Q3 2025).\n     - S&P 500 net profit margins: 13.1% (highest since 2009).\n     - Subprime auto loan delinquencies (60+ days past due): 6.65% (highest since 1994).\n     - Overall consumer loan delinquencies (30+ days past due): 4.5% (highest since Q1 2020).\n\n  3. **Companies, Sectors, or Markets Affected**:\n     - **FTI Consulting**: Directly impacted by leverage, valuation, and restructuring demand.\n     - **Leveraged Middle-Market Enterprises (LMEs)**: Facing credit stress and potential defaults.\n     - **Auto Lenders (e.g., Tricolor)**: Experiencing elevated defaults.\n     - **Consumer Lending Market**: Rising delinquencies across subprime and broader consumer loans.\n     - **S&P 500 Companies**: Strong earnings growth and profitability, but potential risks from consumer spending slowdowns.\n     - **Restructuring and Advisory Firms**: Benefiting from increased demand for restructuring and forensic consulting services.\n\n  4. **Time-Sensitive Elements/Catalysts**:\n     - **Earnings Season (Q3 2025)**: Record profitability for S&P 500 companies, but signs of consumer stress.\n     - **Credit Market Conditions**: Rising delinquencies and defaults, particularly in subprime auto loans.\n     - **Economic Outlook**: Low recession expectations, but risks from consumer spending slowdowns and market corrections.\n     - **FTI's Strategic Position**: Potential for increased restructuring mandates due to credit stress, though M&A activity remains subdued.\n\n  5. **Prioritization**:\n     - Led with FTI's financial position and valuation as the core focus of the article.\n     - Highlighted broader market conditions (earnings growth, delinquencies) to contextualize FTI's opportunities and risks.\n     - Emphasized quantitative data to provide concrete insights for deal activity and market conditions.\n     - Noted time-sensitive elements (e.g., Q3 2025 earnings, rising delinquencies) to underscore urgency for strategic action.\n  \",\n\n  \"summary\": \"\n  FTI Consulting\u2019s financial position has shifted from a net cash position of $386.3 million in September 2024 to a net debt of $364 million (0.8x trailing EBITDA) as of September 30, 2025. This increase in leverage places FTI on the cusp of investment-grade and junk ratings (Ba1/BBB-). Despite a $5 billion market cap, the stock trades at a discounted P/E multiple of 17.1x for 2026 earnings, well below its five-year average of 24x. Analyst coverage remains limited, with only three analysts following the stock, and insider activity has been muted, with net sales of 2,689 shares over the past year.\n\n  Broader market conditions present both opportunities and risks for FTI. The S&P 500 reported record earnings growth of 14.7% YoY in Q3 2025, with net profit margins reaching 13.1%, the highest since 2009. However, consumer credit stress is escalating, with subprime auto loan delinquencies (60+ days past due) hitting 6.65%, the highest level since 1994, and overall consumer loan delinquencies (30+ days past due) rising to 4.5%. These trends are driving demand for restructuring and forensic consulting services, areas where FTI holds a leading position. High-profile defaults, such as those of Tricolor and First Brands Group, are generating complex mandates for FTI\u2019s restructuring and investigation teams.\n\n  While M&A activity remains subdued, the current credit environment is creating near-term opportunities for FTI in restructuring and advisory work. The firm\u2019s strong relationships with lenders and its expertise in forensic and litigation consulting position it to capture a significant share of mandates in the event of further credit deterioration. However, the economic division remains unprofitable, and a rebound in M&A activity is not expected until 2026 at the earliest. The firm\u2019s ability to navigate this cyclical downturn while capitalizing on restructuring demand will be critical to its strategic positioning in the medium term.\n  \"\n}\n```",
