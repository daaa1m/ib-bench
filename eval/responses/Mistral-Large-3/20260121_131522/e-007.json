Goldman Sachs maintains a 'Buy' rating with a 12-month price target of $330, while JPMorgan reiterates an 'Overweight' rating with a $340 price target, reflecting confidence in Alphabet's strategic positioning and execution.\\n\\nAlphabet's Google Search revenue grew by 14.5% YoY in Q3 2025, according to JPMorgan, driven by AI-driven query expansion and improved monetization through formats like AI Overviews (AIO) and AI Mode (AIM). Both banks note that AI is enhancing search frequency and complexity, offsetting potential declines in clicks per query with higher conversion rates and pricing power. Goldman Sachs corroborates this strength, emphasizing broad-based growth in paid clicks and CPCs (+7% YoY).\\n\\nGoogle Cloud remains a standout, with both banks reporting 34% YoY revenue growth. Goldman Sachs highlights a 79% YoY increase in revenue backlog and 23% segment operating margins, attributing this to AI-driven workloads and competitive positioning. JPMorgan echoes this sentiment, noting a $155 billion backlog, up 43% from Q2, and expects further growth from enterprise AI demand and partnerships.\\n\\nBoth banks acknowledge Alphabet's elevated FY2025 capex guidance of $91-93 billion, up from $85 billion, reflecting continued investment in AI infrastructure and data centers. Goldman Sachs adjusted its 2026 capex estimate to $122 billion, signaling sustained investment in long-term growth opportunities. Despite this, both banks anticipate a balanced approach to cost management, ensuring upward margin trajectory.\\n\\nYouTube's ad revenue growth (+15% YoY) and subscription momentum were also key themes, with Goldman Sachs noting the platform's expanding user base and monetization efficiency. The integration of AI across YouTube and other services is expected to further enhance user engagement and revenue streams.\\n\\nOverall, both banks agree on Alphabet's strong execution in leveraging AI to drive growth across its core businesses, while managing investments and margins effectively. The primary drivers of valuation include sustained Google Search and Cloud growth, strategic AI investments, and margin expansion, positioning Alphabet favorably for long-term outperformance.\"\n}\n```",
