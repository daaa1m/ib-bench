  "raw_response": "It seems there was an issue identifying the \"Balance Check\" row in the dataset. Let's refine the approach to locate the balance check failure and trace the cash flow statement linkages more accurately.\n\nI'll re-examine the sheet to find the relevant rows and columns, focusing on the balance check and working capital changes. Let's proceed with this analysis.From the data preview, I can identify the structure of the balance sheet and cash flow statement linkages. The \"Balance Check\" row is not immediately visible in the first 20 rows, but I can see the working capital components such as \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Prepaid Expenses and Deposits.\"\n\nLet's focus on the cash flow statement linkages, particularly the working capital changes, to identify where the formula might be incorrect. I'll look for the relevant cash flow statement rows and trace the error.It seems the specific rows for \"Accounts Receivable\" and \"Prepaid Expenses and Deposits\" were not found as expected. Let's directly inspect the relevant cash flow statement section in the sheet to locate the formulas and identify any incorrect signs or references.\n\nI'll manually check the rows around the working capital changes in the sheet.It seems the direct inspection did not yield the expected cash flow statement formulas. Let's try a different approach by identifying the \"Balance Check\" row and tracing back from there to locate the error in the cash flow linkages.\n\nI will search for the \"Balance Check\" row explicitly and then trace the formulas.I have located the \"Balance Check\" row and extracted its values. The first year where the balance check fails should be evident from non-zero values in this row.\n\nNow, I will trace the cash flow statement linkages, focusing on the working capital changes, to identify the incorrect formula. Let's proceed with this analysis to find and correct the error.I've identified the first year where the balance check fails and extracted the relevant working capital formulas for that year. Let's analyze these formulas to locate the incorrect sign or structure.\n\nI will now inspect the specific formula for \"Accounts Receivable\" or \"Prepaid Expenses\" to determine the error and apply the necessary correction.It seems the \"Accounts Receivable\" row was not directly found, likely due to a mismatch in the exact label. However, based on standard accounting logic, an increase in accounts receivable should be a negative cash flow.\n\nLet's directly apply the correction to the working capital formula for the identified failure column, assuming the error is in the \"Accounts Receivable\" line. I'll implement the fix and verify the balance sheet ties.It appears the exact \"Accounts Receivable\" row was not located due to label discrepancies. However, the logic for correcting the formula remains valid: an increase in accounts receivable should result in a negative cash flow.\n\nGiven this, I will manually inspect the sheet to find the correct row and apply the necessary fix. Let's finalize this correction.",
