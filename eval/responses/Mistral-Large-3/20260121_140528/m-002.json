However, based on the press release summary for 2Q 2024, I can extract the following key figures for the Marine Transportation segment:\n\n- **Revenues**: $484.8 million\n- **Operating Income**: $94.9 million\n\nI will proceed with updating the model using these figures, focusing on the relevant rows for revenue and operating income.
