However, I can still guide you through the steps to implement the requested changes manually in your LBO model:\n\n### Steps to Implement Interest Expense Circularity\n\n1. **Add a Circularity Switch:**\n   - In the \"Assumptions\" sheet, add a new row at the top.\n   - Label one cell as \"Circ Switch\" (in blue font for hardcoded labels).\n   - In the adjacent cell, enter `1` (in blue font) to turn circularity ON.\n\n2. **Modify Interest Expense Calculation:**\n   - Locate the \"Interest Expense\" row in the \"Model\" sheet.\n   - Replace the existing formula with the following logic:\n     ```\n     =IF(Assumptions.$B$1, (DebtSchedule.DebtBegin + DebtSchedule.DebtEnd)/2 * Rate, DebtSchedule.DebtBegin * Rate)\n     ```\n   - Apply green font to this formula as it references another sheet.\n\n3. **Enable Iterative Calculations in Excel:**\n   - Go to `File` > `Options` > `Formulas`.\n   - Check the box for \"Enable iterative calculation\".\n\n4. **Verify the Model:**\n   - Ensure the model balances and that the interest expense values update correctly when toggling the circularity switch.\n\n### JSON Summary Example\nOnce you implement the above changes, extract the values from row 164 (Total Cash Interest) and provide them in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"K164\": 12000,\n  \"L164\": 11500,\n  \"M164\": 11000,\n  \"N164\": 10500,\n  \"O164\": 10000,\n  \"implementation_notes\": \"Added circularity switch in Assumptions sheet, modified interest expense calculation to use average of beginning and ending debt with a toggle for circularity.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Download the Modified File\nSince I cannot directly modify the file, please follow the steps above. If you re-upload the file in a compatible format (e.g., `.xlsx` or `.ods`), I can assist further with automation.
