        "question": "How are you adjusting pricing strategies in response to Family Dollar\u2019s store closures (600+ planned in 2024), and what categories are most vulnerable to competitive encroachment from dollar stores and discounters?",
        "why_it_matters": "Family Dollar\u2019s closures may create short-term market share opportunities, but long-term pricing power could erode as Aldi and Walmart expand in rural markets. Consumables (e.g., snacks, HBA) are most at risk.",

    "methodology_notes": "Questions were prioritized based on (1) materiality to near-term financial performance (e.g., shrink, SNAP exposure), (2) competitive threats (e.g., Aldi, Walmart), and (3) strategic initiatives (e.g., media network, digital). Topics were cross-referenced with recent filings, earnings calls, and industry reports to ensure specificity.",
    "reasoning_steps": [
      "Step 1: Gathered context from Dollar General\u2019s 10-Q (Nov 2023), Q3 2023 earnings call transcript, and 2023 Investor Day presentation to identify financial and operational pain points (e.g., shrink, SG&A, SSS decline).",
      "Step 2: Analyzed competitive dynamics using news reports (e.g., Aldi\u2019s expansion, Family Dollar closures) and industry data (e.g., SNAP enrollment trends, retail media growth).",
      "Step 3: Prioritized questions by financial impact (e.g., shrink\u2019s $1.4B drag) and strategic urgency (e.g., digital profitability, labor automation).",
      "Step 4: Validated coverage of all required topics and ensured questions probed root causes (e.g., SKU rationalization metrics) rather than surface-level trends."
