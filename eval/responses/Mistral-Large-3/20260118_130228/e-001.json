  "raw_response": "The analysis of the provided data reveals the following key observations:\n\n1. **Balance Check Row (Row 122):**\n   - The \"Check\" row (Row 122) is meant to verify if Total Assets equal Total Liabilities + Equity. It shows a non-zero value starting from 2022, indicating an imbalance.\n\n2. **Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet Linkage:**\n   - The \"EoP Cash & Cash Equivalents\" (End of Period Cash) in the Cash Flow Statement (Row 149) should directly link to the Cash line item on the Balance Sheet. However, the discrepancy suggests this link might be broken or misaligned.\n\n3. **Error Identification:**\n   - The imbalance starts in 2022 with a value of 33.87, which grows over time. This suggests a linkage error rather than a hard-coded one.\n   - The \"Cash Sweep\" (Row 147) is a significant outflow that might not be correctly reflected in the Balance Sheet.\n\n### Audit Steps Followed:\n- **Circularity Control:** Assessed potential iterative loops, focusing on cash flow and balance sheet interactions.\n- **Variance Analysis:** Identified the \"Break Year\" (2022) and observed the growing imbalance.\n- **Half-Number Sign Check:** The variance does not directly suggest a sign flip, as it is not exactly double any single line item.\n- **Linkage Integrity:** Verified summation ranges and the linkage of Ending Cash from the Cash Flow Statement to the Balance Sheet.\n\n### Error Location and Fix:\nThe error likely lies in the **linkage of the \"Cash Sweep\" to the Balance Sheet**.
