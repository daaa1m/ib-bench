Goldman Sachs maintains a 'Buy' rating with a raised 12-month price target of $330, up from $288, reflecting confidence in Alphabet's GAAP EBITDA trajectory and free cash flow stability. JPMorgan reiterates its 'Overweight' rating, increasing its December 2026 price target to $340 from $300, based on a 27.5x multiple of 2027E GAAP EPS of $12.43.\n\nBoth banks highlight Alphabet's robust Q3 performance, particularly in Google Search and Google Cloud. Goldman Sachs notes a 15% YoY growth in Google Search revenue, driven by strength across all major verticals, while JPMorgan reports a 14.5% YoY acceleration in Search revenue, attributing this to AI-driven query expansion and improved monetization through AI Overviews and AI Mode. Both analysts emphasize the role of AI in enhancing user engagement and ad revenue potential, with JPMorgan underscoring the successful balance of monetization and user experience in AI-driven search formats.\n\nGoogle Cloud remains a standout segment, with both banks reporting 34% YoY revenue growth. Goldman Sachs highlights a 46% QoQ increase in backlog to $155 billion, alongside strong enterprise AI demand, while JPMorgan notes the acceleration in Cloud growth supported by enterprise AI products and a significant increase in processed tokens. Both banks acknowledge the strategic importance of Alphabet's full-stack AI approach, including custom TPUs and industry-leading models, in sustaining Cloud momentum.\n\nCapex guidance emerged as a focal point, with Alphabet raising its FY2025 outlook to $91-93 billion, up from $85 billion. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan both interpret this increase as a necessary investment in infrastructure to support AI and Cloud growth, though they caution that elevated capital intensity may persist into 2026. Goldman Sachs adjusted its 2026 capex estimate to $122 billion, reflecting expectations of continued heavy investment.\n\nYouTube's performance also drew attention, with both banks noting 15% YoY growth in ad revenue. Goldman Sachs highlights the growing contribution from subscription offerings, particularly Google One and YouTube Premium, which monetize at higher gross profits than ads. JPMorgan adds that YouTube's recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth, further supporting monetization.\n\nIn synthesizing these views, the key drivers of Alphabet's valuation include AI-driven search monetization, Google Cloud's enterprise AI adoption, strategic capex investments, and YouTube's dual revenue streams from ads and subscriptions. Both banks agree on Alphabet's strong positioning in AI and Cloud, though JPMorgan places slightly more emphasis on the transformative potential of AI in search, while Goldman Sachs focuses on the broader operational efficiencies and margin trajectory. The divergence in price targets reflects differing multiples applied to forward earnings, with JPMorgan's higher target suggesting greater confidence in Alphabet's long-term growth narrative.\"\n}\n```\nHere is the extracted and synthesized information in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"gs_rating\": \"Buy\",\n  \"gs_price_target\": 330,\n  \"jpm_rating\": \"Overweight\",\n  \"jpm_price_target\": 340,\n  \"q3_search_growth\": 14.5,\n  \"q3_cloud_growth\": 34,\n  \"fy25_capex_guidance\": \"91-93\",\n  \"key_drivers\": [\n    \"AI-driven expansion in Google Search and monetization through AI Overviews and AI Mode\",\n    \"Google Cloud revenue growth and backlog expansion driven by enterprise AI demand\",\n    \"Elevated capex investments in infrastructure to support AI and Cloud growth\",\n    \"YouTube Ads and Subscription growth, particularly from YouTube Premium and Music\",\n    \"Operating margin trajectory and efficiency improvements amid heavy investments\"\n  ],\n  \"summary\": \"Following Alphabet's Q3 2025 earnings, both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have reaffirmed positive outlooks, albeit with distinct perspectives on valuation drivers.
