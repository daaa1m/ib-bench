Despite headwinds in economic consulting and technology, FTI delivered a record 3Q: revenue +3.3% YoY to $956.2m and EPS +41% to $2.60.  Growth in higher-demand segments was strong: corporate finance +18.6%, forensic & litigation +15.4%, strategic communications +7.4% (3Q). \\n\\nCompany-specific dislocations / risk items: Economic consulting profitability deteriorated sharply amid talent disruption following the 2023 firing of a key figure and formation of a rival firm in Dec. 2024; segment EBITDA swung to -$4.6m in the quarter vs +$35.2m prior year, while technology EBITDA fell 17.1%.  Management turnover is also noted: CFO resignation announced Aug. 12.

Balance sheet shows ~$364m net debt (~0.8x trailing EBITDA) as of Sept. 30; ratings sit on the IG/HY cusp (Ba1/BBB-).  Capital return is aggressive: $846.1m repurchased in the year through mid-October (share count -14.1%) plus a new $500m authorization disclosed on the Oct. 23 earnings call; CEO purchased $1.1m of stock (7,500 shares) the next day (first open-market buy since 2017).  \\n\\nM&A market condition read-through and catalysts: The article explicitly notes that \u201cthe dearth of transactions has dashed hopes for a 2025 rebound,\u201d but expects M&A activity to recover, and suggests economic consulting could bottom over the next couple quarters.  A bullish setup described for 2026 is a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d mix of (i) M&A picking up and (ii) ongoing disruption (tech, rates, and renewed LME activity), which would benefit multi-practice advisory firms. \\n\\nOther markets/companies flagged (strategic/coverage implications):\\n- Indonesia tobacco (PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna; 92.4% owned by Philip Morris International): share price down ~88% in USD since Jan 2018, attributed to tobacco tax increases compounding at 12.5% annually (2016\u20132024).   Policy catalyst: after the finance minister who drove hikes left office, successor is holding tax rates steady this year and next; authorities have seized 816m illicit cigarettes YTD, suggesting enforcement focus.  Company pays out 100% of earnings as dividends and had net cash of 5.1tn rupiah (~$247m) as of Sept. 30. \\n- Philippines retail (Puregold Price Club): Philippines market underperformed in 2025 (PSE Index -10.7% USD) vs MSCI World +16.2% and MSCI EM +29%; valuation discount cited (Philippines ~9.4x trailing vs MSCI EM ~16x).  Puregold operates 513 supermarkets and 31 S&R price-club stores; S&R generated 47% of EBITDA in 1H25 despite smaller store count.  Puregold bought a 153-store mini-mart franchise (Puremart) in Dec 2024 for ~$10m (~$65k/store, at book value).
