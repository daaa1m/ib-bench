Diluted EPS was $1.95, reflecting net income of $21,187 million, which benefited from sizable non-operating gains (including $10,186 million in other income/expense, net) tied to investment-related marks and reclassifications (notably Anthropic-related gains cited by management).  \\n\\nSegment Performance and Key Drivers\\nGrowth was broad-based across the three reporting segments, led by AWS. North America delivered net sales of $106,267 million (+11% Y/Y) but operating income declined to $4,789 million, driven by higher fulfillment, technology/infrastructure, and other operating costs, including a $2.5 billion FTC legal settlement charge recorded in other operating expense and company-wide severance costs from planned role eliminations. International net sales were $40,896 million (+14% Y/Y) with operating income of $1,199 million, pressured by higher shipping and fulfillment costs (also including severance). AWS was the key profit engine: net sales rose to $33,006 million (+20% Y/Y) and operating income increased to $11,434 million, supported by higher customer usage but partly offset by elevated infrastructure investment and severance costs.  \\n\\nStrategic/Operational Highlights\\nManagement emphasized accelerating AI-driven demand in AWS and rapid product velocity across the AI stack, including strong adoption of Trainium2 (described as fully subscribed and a multi-billion-dollar business), scaling of major AI compute capacity (e.g., \u201cProject Rainier\u201d), and continued expansion of AWS infrastructure/power capacity (+3.8 gigawatts added over the last 12 months). In Stores/retail operations, leadership highlighted ongoing fulfillment network improvements aimed at faster Prime delivery speeds and expanded same-day grocery reach (targeting 2,300+ communities by year-end). \\n\\nCosts, One-Time Items, and Risks\\nQuarterly operating income was negatively impacted by two notable items: a $2.5 billion FTC settlement charge and approximately $1.8 billion of estimated severance costs from planned role eliminations, impacting all three segments. Key risk framing in company disclosures continues to include macro demand variability, FX, competition, regulatory/legal outcomes, and execution risks in fulfillment and data center optimization; guidance also explicitly assumes no additional material acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements.  \\n\\nQ4 2025 Outlook\\nFor Q4 2025, Amazon guided net sales of $206.0\u2013$213.0 billion (10%\u201313% Y/Y growth), assuming a ~190 bp FX tailwind, and operating income of $21.0\u2013$26.0 billion (vs. $21.2 billion in Q4 2024). The implied setup suggests continued strong AWS-led growth with profitability dependent on peak-season execution and cost discipline amid elevated infrastructure and restructuring-related spend. \"\n}",
