Both banks highlight Google Search revenue growth of approximately 14.5% YoY, with management disclosing that paid clicks and CPCs each grew 7% YoY. JPMorgan emphasizes that AI search formats are proving to be opportunity rather than threat, with AI Overviews monetizing at roughly the same rate as traditional search while driving incremental query growth. Goldman Sachs notes broad-based strength across all major verticals. Both models project Search growth moderating to 11-13% in 2026, though JPMorgan is slightly more optimistic on the trajectory.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud acceleration represents the quarter's standout performance. Revenue grew 34% YoY to $15.2bn with segment operating margins reaching 23%, well above expectations. Cloud backlog surged 46% QoQ to $155bn, with management noting more $1bn+ deals signed YTD than in the prior two years combined. Goldman Sachs projects Cloud revenue of $77bn in 2026 (+33% YoY), while JPMorgan models similar growth rates. Both banks view the full-stack AI approach\u2014custom TPUs, industry-leading models, and enterprise AI products\u2014as a sustainable competitive advantage.\\n\\nCapital intensity remains the primary investor debate. Management raised FY25 capex guidance to $91-93bn from $85bn, with both banks modeling approximately $92bn. Goldman Sachs projects 2026 capex of $122bn (+32% YoY), while JPMorgan estimates $141bn (+53% YoY), reflecting differing assumptions on infrastructure investment required to meet Cloud demand. Both analysts acknowledge depreciation pressure on the P&L, with Q3 D&A up 41% YoY and acceleration expected in Q4.\\n\\nYouTube continues to demonstrate momentum with 15% YoY advertising growth. JPMorgan highlights that Shorts now earns more revenue per watch hour than traditional in-stream video in the US, while Goldman Sachs notes the growing contribution from subscription offerings, with total paid subscriptions surpassing 300 million.\\n\\nValuation approaches differ modestly. Goldman Sachs applies a blended EV/EBITDA and DCF methodology, deriving a $330 target at 22x NTM+1 EBITDA. JPMorgan uses a P/E framework, applying 27.5x to 2027E GAAP EPS of $12.43 for a $340 target. Both see Alphabet trading at a premium to the S&P 500 as justified given double-digit revenue and EPS growth off a large base with 30%+ operating margins.\"\n}\n",
