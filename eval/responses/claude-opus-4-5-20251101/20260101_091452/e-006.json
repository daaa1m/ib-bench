Let me implement the circularity switch:\n\n1. **Circularity Switch Location**: I'll place it in row 5, columns C and F (near the assumptions area)\n2. **Interest Formulas to Modify**:\n   - Row 173 (RCF Cash Interest): Currently uses BoP balance (row 168), needs to use average of BoP (168) and EoP (171)\n   - Row 181 (Acquisition Financing Cash Interest): Currently uses BoP balance (row 177), needs to use average of BoP (177) and EoP (179)\nNow I need to calculate the values with circularity ON. Since this involves circular references, I need to use an iterative calculation approach:\nNow I understand the model structure. The circularity flows through:\n- Interest expense (row 164 \u2192 row 136) affects taxes (row 130)\n- Taxes affect Unlevered FCF (row 133)\n- Unlevered FCF + Interest = Levered FCF (row 137)\n- Levered FCF affects debt repayment (rows 139, 140, 141, 178)\n- Debt repayment affects ending debt balances (rows 171, 179)\n- Ending debt balances affect interest expense (rows 173, 181)\n\nLet me use a Python-based iterative solver to calculate the values:\nLet me verify these calculations by comparing with the original model values (without circularity):\nI see the original model values. Now let me recalculate more carefully - I need to verify my calculation matches the original model's logic:\n",
