FLNA has experienced: (1) volume declines for multiple consecutive quarters, (2) market share losses to competitors and private label, (3) margin compression despite (or because of) aggressive pricing, and (4) deteriorating retailer relationships.

The activist argues: (1) Management prioritized short-term price realization over volume and market share, a strategy that worked temporarily post-COVID but has now backfired as consumers became more price-sensitive; (2) FLNA's volume declines are accelerating rather than stabilizing, suggesting the problem is getting worse, not better; (3) Competitors (both branded and private label) have gained share by offering better value, and this share is proving sticky; (4) Management has lost credibility with investors after repeatedly missing guidance and providing overly optimistic commentary that failed to materialize; (5) The board has not held management sufficiently accountable for these failures.
