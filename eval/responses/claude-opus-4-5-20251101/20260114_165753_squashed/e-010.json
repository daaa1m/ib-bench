  "raw_response": "Now I can see the balance sheet doesn't tie from 2023 onwards (J39:S39 are False). Let me examine the FS Calcs sheet to trace the errors:\nNow let me look at the P&L sheet to understand the full picture:\nNow let me calculate the exact discrepancy in the balance sheet to understand the magnitude of the errors:\nThe balance sheet is off starting from 2023. The discrepancy grows each year. Let me trace through the cash flow statement and balance sheet movements to find the errors:\nI found the first error! The Investing Cash Flow formula in row 70 for columns J onwards is `=SUM(J67:J69)` but it should be `=SUM(J66:J69)` to include row 66 (Addition of PPE incl leases). Let me verify this:\nConfirmed! The first error is that Row 70 (Investing Cash Flow) is missing Row 66 (Addition of PPE incl leases) in its sum formula. Now let me check if there are other errors by looking at the remaining discrepancy:\nThe Row 70 error alone doesn't explain the full discrepancy. The BS difference is much larger and accumulates. Let me trace through the debt calculations and cash flow more carefully:\nGood - the Debt Calcs correctly references all three rows (66, 67, 68). The issue is that the BS & CFS Investing Cash Flow (row 70) is missing row 66. Let me trace through more carefully to understand the full impact:\nThe cash flow statement doesn't tie to the change in cash. The difference equals the missing Row 66 (PPE additions). This confirms the first error.\n\nNow let me check if there are additional errors. The balance sheet discrepancy is much larger than just the Row 70 error. Let me look at the FS Calcs sheet more carefully:\nThere's a consistent 2.31 difference between PPE additions in FS Calcs and the CFS. Let me check the formula:\n",
