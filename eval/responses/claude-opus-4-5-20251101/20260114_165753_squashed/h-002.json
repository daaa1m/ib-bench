    "historical_updates": "Populated three fiscal years (FY22-FY24 ending Feb 2022-2024) using Albertsons SEC 10-K filings and earnings releases. Key historicals: Revenue $77.6B-$79.2B, Adj. EBITDA $4.1B-$4.8B (5.2%-6.2% margin), ~2,269 stores, 402 fuel centers, 285,000 employees. Sources: SEC EDGAR filings (10-K FY2024), company earnings releases, Yahoo Finance income statement data.",
    "assumptions_summary": "Entry: $17.50/share with 30% premium ($13.2B equity), $13.5B net debt assumed (including operating leases), $26.7B EV at 6.4x FY24 EBITDA. Leverage: 3.5x EBITDA new debt ($14.5B acquisition financing), 3.0x equity contribution. Projections: 2-2.5% annual revenue growth, 30bp annual COGS margin improvement, flat SG&A as % of sales, capex at 2.4% of sales. Employee growth 0.5% annually, wage inflation 2-3%.",
    "returns_summary": "Base Case Returns: 16.7% IRR, 2.17x MOIC over 5-year hold. Exit at 7.0x EV/EBITDA (modest premium to entry 6.4x) on Year 5 EBITDA of $5.5B = $38.7B exit EV. Net equity proceeds after debt paydown $27.3B vs $12.6B equity investment. Deleveraging from 3.1x to 1.5x Net Debt/EBITDA through FCF generation ($1.0-1.8B annually).",
    "business_assessment": "Market Position: #2 U.S. grocery retailer with 2,269 stores across 34 states, strong regional presence (Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco banners). Strengths: Defensive grocery demand, strong pharmacy (1,725 locations), 24% digital growth, 45.6M loyalty members, $16.5B Own Brands revenue. Weaknesses: High leverage ($7.8B debt + $6B leases), compressed 5.2% EBITDA margin, 195,000 unionized employees, capital-intensive model ($1.9B annual capex). Key risks: Walmart/Costco pricing pressure, Amazon/Instacart disruption, rising shrink, union labor negotiations. Failed Kroger merger ($24.6B deal) validates strategic value but highlights M&A regulatory challenges.",
    "recommendation": "CONDITIONAL GO - Recommend investment subject to achieving favorable entry valuation. Rationale: (1) Attractive 16.7% IRR in base case with downside protected by defensive grocery demand; (2) Clear value creation path through margin expansion and digital/pharmacy growth; (3) Strong FCF supports deleveraging from 3.1x to 1.5x; (4) Failed Kroger merger creates opportunity to acquire at discount. Key conditions: Entry below 6.5x EBITDA, management retention post-merger termination, and conviction on 50bp+ margin expansion. Next steps: Deep dive on pharmacy economics, union contract schedule, and regional competitive dynamics.",
    "model_integrity_checks": "Sources = Uses tie confirmed ($27.116B each). EBITDA rollforward verified: Gross Profit + Other Income - Employee Costs - Admin - Other - Rent = EBITDA. FCF calculation verified: EBITDA + Capex + WC + Taxes + Interest = Levered FCF. Debt schedule ties to cash flow (BoP + repayments = EoP). Balance sheet Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash. IRR calculated using XIRR function on equity cash flows. All formulas recalculated via LibreOffice with zero errors.",
    "formatting": "Applied IB formatting conventions: Blue font for hardcoded inputs (share price, premium, leverage multiples, growth rates, cost percentages), Black font for all formulas. Preserved template structure including Sources/Uses, KPIs, P&L, Cash Flows, Working Capital, Debt Schedule, and Returns sections. Number formatting: commas for thousands, percentages with 1 decimal, multiples with 1 decimal and 'x' suffix. Years displayed without comma separators.",
    "reasoning_steps": [
      "Step 1: Mapped Albertsons fiscal year structure (ending late February) to template date cells. Gathered historical financials from SEC 10-K filings for FY2022-FY2024, including revenue by segment (grocery vs fuel), EBITDA, store count, employee count, and working capital metrics. Cross-referenced against Yahoo Finance income statement and company earnings releases for validation.",
      "Step 2: Built projections using bottom-up drivers: stores growing 5-9 annually, revenue/store growth of 1.5-2.5% (LfL assumption), fuel revenue flat at $12M/station. Expense ratios modeled as % of sales with 30bp annual COGS improvement from supply chain initiatives. D&A linked to capex at 85%. Working capital projected using historical DIO/DSO/DPO averages. Returns computed via XIRR/MOIC formulas with 7.0x exit multiple applied to Year 5 EBITDA."
