Identified 'greater of' mechanics in debt baskets (clause (i), (xv), (xxvi)) combining fixed dollar amounts with EBITDA percentages. Builder basket mechanics in Section 4.06(a)(B) use cumulative EBITDA minus 1.70x interest coverage. Asset sale application period is 450 days with 180-day extension for Acceptable Commitments. Change of Control offer at 101% with 20-60 day payment window."
