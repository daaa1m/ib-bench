    "explanation": "The Change in NWC formula had the wrong sign. In a cash flow statement, an increase in Net Working Capital is a USE of cash and should appear as a negative value. The original formula (Current NWC - Prior NWC) produced a positive value when NWC increased, incorrectly showing a source of cash instead of a use. The corrected formula (Prior NWC - Current NWC) produces a negative value when NWC increases, correctly reflecting the cash outflow. This error caused a cumulative balance sheet discrepancy equal to 2x the change in NWC each period, which compounded through the forecast.",
    "reasoning_steps": [
      "Step 1: Identified the first period where the balance sheet check fails - Row 39 showed FALSE starting from 2023 (Column J). Historical periods (2018-2022) all showed TRUE, indicating the error was introduced in the forecast formulas.",
      "Step 2: Calculated the balance sheet difference for 2023: Total Assets exceeded Liabilities + Equity by approximately 10.71, which exactly matched 2x the Change in NWC value (5.357). This pattern confirmed a sign error in the working capital change formula, as the impact doubles when the sign is reversed.",
      "Step 3: Traced the cash flow linkage through Debt Calcs sheet where cash is calculated as BoP Cash + Net Cash Flow, and Net Cash Flow includes OCF which contains the Chg in NWC line item at Row 61.",
      "Step 4: Verified the fix by reversing the formula order from (Current - Prior) to (Prior - Current), which correctly produces negative values when NWC increases. After recalculating with iterative mode enabled, the balance sheet tied for all forecast periods with differences of effectively zero."
