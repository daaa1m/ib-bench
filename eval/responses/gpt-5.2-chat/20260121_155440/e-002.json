The 'Credit cycle play' section focusing on private equity\u2013backed company takeovers and restructuring advisers was selected as the primary article because it contains concrete deal volume data, sponsor behavior, and implications for advisory and credit markets. I extracted quantitative metrics (number of takeovers, growth rates, valuation references, operating performance) and focused on implications for restructuring, distressed M&A, and creditor-led control situations, which are most relevant to senior investment bankers.\",\n  \"summary\": \"The article\u2019s core takeaway is that the credit cycle is turning decisively, with a sharp increase in creditor takeovers of private equity\u2013backed companies, creating a more active restructuring and distressed advisory environment. In the first nine months of 2025, creditors took control of more than 45 PE-sponsored companies, the fastest pace in at least six years and more than double the total in 2024, according to Lincoln International. This reflects growing sponsor fatigue and a willingness to hand keys to lenders rather than inject additional equity .\\n\\nThis shift is occurring despite headline high-yield default rates remaining around a moderate ~5%, as many problem credits are being addressed through liability management exercises (LMEs) rather than formal bankruptcies. However, these LMEs often fail (an estimated 9 out of 10), ultimately driving companies back into deeper restructurings and court-supervised processes, which increases demand for operational and financial advisory services .\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, the article highlights FTI Consulting as a key beneficiary of rising restructuring activity. While FTI\u2019s share price has declined roughly 30% from its peak amid concerns about LMEs, management turnover, and AI disruption, operating performance remains strong. In Q3 2025, FTI reported revenue of $956.2 million (+3.3% YoY) and EPS of $2.60 (+41% YoY), both record highs. Corporate finance revenues grew 18.6%, forensic and litigation consulting 15.4%, and strategic communications 7.4%, underscoring diversified demand across stressed and complex situations .\\n\\nStrategically, the article implies a multi-year opportunity for banks and advisers in creditor-led M&A, restructurings, and rescue financings as higher rates and slowing cash flows pressure leveraged capital structures. The growing willingness of lenders to assume ownership suggests increased deal flow in distressed asset sales, debt-for-equity swaps, and sponsor-to-creditor transitions, with restructuring advisory, valuation, and special situations expertise becoming increasingly central to transaction execution.\"",
