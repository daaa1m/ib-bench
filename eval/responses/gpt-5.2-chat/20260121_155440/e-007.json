While each analyst emphasizes slightly different elements of the story, both converge on the view that Alphabet is successfully monetizing generative AI across Search, YouTube, and Cloud while maintaining disciplined cost control, justifying premium valuation multiples.\\n\\nGoldman Sachs maintains a Buy rating and raised its 12\u2011month price target to $330 from $288, reflecting higher forward revenue, EBITDA, and EPS estimates following the Q3 beat . Goldman highlights Search and YouTube as core earnings engines, pointing to management disclosure that both paid clicks and CPCs grew approximately 7% YoY in Q3, supporting double\u2011digit Search revenue growth. The firm views AI integration (AI Overviews, Gemini, and AI Mode) as expanding query complexity and advertiser ROI rather than cannibalizing monetization. Goldman\u2019s model incorporates Q3 Search revenue growth in the mid\u2011teens and YouTube Ads growth of roughly 15% YoY, alongside accelerating contribution from subscriptions. Cloud is framed as the standout segment, with 34% YoY revenue growth and improving profitability, reinforcing Alphabet\u2019s long\u2011term margin expansion thesis. Goldman also adjusted FY2025 capex guidance upward to a $91\u201393bn range (from ~$85bn previously), with a materially higher FY2026 capex assumption, reflecting sustained AI infrastructure investment .\\n\\nJPMorgan reiterates its Overweight rating and raises its December 2026 price target to $340, based on ~27.5x 2027E GAAP EPS of $12.43, or ~26x excluding Other Bets . JPMorgan places heavier emphasis on the strategic implications of AI in Search, arguing that AI is expanding, not compressing, the Search TAM. The analyst notes Search revenue growth accelerating to 14.5% YoY in Q3, with AI formats driving higher query frequency and improved conversion rates, offsetting any decline in clicks per query . JPMorgan also underscores Google Cloud as a critical valuation driver, highlighting 34% YoY revenue growth, ~79% YoY backlog growth to $155bn, and segment operating margins above 20%, which materially lift medium\u2011term consolidated EBITDA assumptions.\\n\\nFrom a model perspective, both banks\u2019 valuations are most sensitive to five shared drivers. First, Search revenue growth assumptions hinge on sustained paid click and pricing momentum as AI features scale. Second, Cloud growth and margin expansion are central, with JPMorgan more aggressive on backlog\u2011to\u2011revenue conversion and long\u2011term profitability. Third, YouTube\u2019s ad recovery and subscription growth support a more diversified revenue mix. Fourth, operating leverage remains critical: both models assume Alphabet can fund AI investments while preserving ~30%+ GAAP operating margins. Finally, capital intensity is a swing factor, with higher capex moderating near\u2011term free cash flow but reinforcing long\u2011term competitive positioning.\\n\\nOverall, Goldman and JPMorgan are aligned in viewing Alphabet\u2019s Q3 2025 results as evidence that generative AI is a net positive for growth, margins, and valuation. Differences are largely in degree rather than direction, with JPMorgan assigning a higher terminal multiple on stronger AI\u2011driven growth confidence, while Goldman balances upside with a more cautious capex and free\u2011cash\u2011flow outlook.",
