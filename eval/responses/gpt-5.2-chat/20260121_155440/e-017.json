  "raw_response": "I was not able to complete the task as specified with sufficient factual certainty.\n\n**Summary of what I found and why it was insufficient:**\n\n- Using public sources, I was able to **verify only a small number of qualifying E&P oil & gas transactions announced in H2 2025** with clearly disclosed deal values \u2265 USD 100m and full deal terms.\n- Two examples that *do* clearly qualify are:\n  - **Ithaca Energy plc acquisition of JAPEX UK E&P Limited**, announced/completed **July 7, 2025**, consideration **USD 193mm** (cash). \n  - **SM Energy / Civitas Resources merger**, announced **November 3, 2025**, all\u2011stock transaction with **enterprise value ~USD 12,800mm**. \n- Many other 2025 oil & gas transactions identified in databases and news:\n  - Were **outside H2 2025** (H1 2025 or earlier),\n  - Were **below the USD 100mm threshold**,\n  - Involved **midstream, services, or minority financial stakes**, not E&P corporate or asset acquisitions,\n  - Or lacked **publicly disclosed deal values or payment structures**, making them non\u2011verifiable under your constraints.\n- I could not confidently identify **10 distinct, fully compliant H2 2025 E&P transactions** with verifiable announcement dates, values, and payment types using public sources alone.\n\nBecause of this:\n- Populating the Excel template with 10 rows would require **assumptions or fabricated data**, which would violate your constraints.\n- Providing a JSON summary with 10 deals would be **factually unreliable**.\n\nIf you would like, I can:\n- Deliver a **partial but fully accurate comp set** (e.g., 5\u20137 verified transactions), or  \n- Expand scope (e.g., include early 2026 announcements, lower value thresholds, or minority E&P stakes), or  \n- Use a **paid M&A database\u2013style approximation** with clear labeling.\n\nNo Excel file or JSON output was produced to avoid breaching accuracy and sourcing requirements.[Oil and Gas Mergers and Acquisitions List [10 Notable Deals]](https://mnacommunity.com/insights/oil-gas-mergers-acquisitions-list/)[Oil and gas M&A expected to pick up in 2025 - PitchBook](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/oil-and-gas-m-a-expected-to-pick-up-in-2025)[SM ENERGY AND CIVITAS RESOURCES TO COMBINE IN $12.8 BILLION ...](https://www.sm-energy.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/359/sm-energy-and-civitas-resources-to-combine-in-12-8-billion-transformational-combination-delivering-superior-stockholder-value)[Oil & Gas in 2025: M&A and Joint Venture Activity | Akin](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/speaking-energy/oil-and-gas-in-2025-manda-and-joint-venture-activity)[Complete List of Recent Oil and Gas Mergers And Acquisitions](https://usearch.com/dataset/oil-and-gas-mergers-and-acquisitions)",
