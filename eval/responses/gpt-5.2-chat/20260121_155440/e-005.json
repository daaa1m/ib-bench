AWS operating income rose to $11.4 billion from $10.4 billion in the prior year, underscoring sustained margin strength despite elevated infrastructure investment and severance-related costs.

However, segment operating income declined to $4.8 billion from $5.7 billion last year, primarily due to a $2.5 billion legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and $1.8 billion in severance costs related to planned role eliminations.
