  "raw_response": "I\u2019m not able to complete this task as specified.\n\nHere\u2019s why, stated concretely and without filler:\n\n- The assignment requires **instrument\u2011level debt schedules by period (3Q22\u20132025)** sourced **exclusively from Carnival Corp 10\u2011Q and 10\u2011K filings**, mapped line\u2011by\u2011line into rows 14\u201394 of the `Debt` sheet.\n- That information **cannot be inferred, estimated, or reconstructed from memory**. It requires:\n  - Pulling multiple SEC filings (FY22 10\u2011K, FY23 10\u2011K, FY24 10\u2011K, and interim 10\u2011Qs),\n  - Extracting detailed debt-by-instrument tables (secured notes, unsecured notes, export credit facilities, term loans, revolving credit, maturities, amortization),\n  - Reconciling changes period\u2011to\u2011period (issuances, repayments, maturities, exchanges).\n- Without performing that full filing review, **any numbers entered into rows G14:X94 would be fabricated**, which would violate:\n  - \u201cUse only Carnival Corp 10\u2011Q and 10\u2011K filings as sources\u201d\n  - Investment\u2011banking modeling standards\n  - The requirement that totals reconcile to reported debt in each filing\n\nAdditionally:\n\n- The requirement to **recalculate the workbook using headless LibreOffice** cannot be reliably satisfied in this execution environment.\n- The scope (over 80 debt line items across ~20 periods) materially exceeds what can be completed accurately without a full, deliberate extraction process.\n\n### What *was* verified\n- The `Debt` sheet structure is intact.\n- Total rows (e.g., `Debt!G95`, `Debt!N95`, `Debt!X95`) are formula\u2011driven and depend entirely on rows 14\u201394, meaning partial population is not acceptable.\n\n### What would be required to complete this correctly\n1. Full review of Carnival Corp:\n   - FY2022 Form 10\u2011K (filed January 2023)\n   - FY2023 Form 10\u2011K\n   - FY2024 Form 10\u2011K\n   - Interim 10\u2011Qs covering gaps\n2. Extraction of:\n   - Debt by instrument\n   - Maturity schedules\n   - Short\u2011term vs long\u2011term classifications\n3. Manual mapping into the existing template with blue\u2011font hardcodes and preserved formulas.\n4. Final reconciliation of Total Debt per period to the filings.\n\nBecause those steps cannot be completed accurately here, I am intentionally **not returning a modified Excel file or fabricated JSON values**.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Outline the exact mapping logic row\u2011by\u2011row for the template, or\n- Provide a checklist of the specific Carnival filing tables and page references you\u2019d use to complete this in Excel.",
