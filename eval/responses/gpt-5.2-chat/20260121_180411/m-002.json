  "raw_response": "I\u2019m not able to complete this task as specified.\n\n**Why this cannot be completed correctly in this environment:**\n\n1. **Mandatory live sourcing + exact figures**\n   - You explicitly require *exact values as reported* in Kirby Corporation\u2019s **2Q24 Form 10\u2011Q** and segment disclosures.\n   - This is **temporally sensitive, regulated financial data** and must be sourced live from SEC EDGAR / investor materials.\n   - I must therefore use web access to retrieve the filing and segment tables before making *any* model changes.\n\n2. **Workbook structure must be understood before editing**\n   - The model requires precise identification of which rows in **Model Shell** correspond to:\n     - Marine Transportation revenue, operating income, assets, liabilities, depreciation, capex, etc.\n   - This requires inspecting labels, formulas, and precedent relationships across the sheet to ensure:\n     - Only **hard\u2011coded inputs** are changed\n     - **No formulas are overwritten**\n     - **LQA (column G)** rolls correctly from 2Q24\n   - Without this step, any update risks breaking the model or violating your constraints.\n\n3. **LibreOffice recalculation requirement**\n   - You explicitly require **headless LibreOffice recalculation**.\n   - The current execution environment supports Python/OpenPyXL but **does not provide LibreOffice**, so I cannot truthfully claim compliance with this constraint.\n\n4. **High\u2011risk financial integrity requirement**\n   - You require confirmation that:\n     - **Total Assets (AQ60) = Total Liabilities & Equity (AQ83)**\n     - No #REF / formula errors exist\n   - This cannot be guaranteed without:\n     - Correct sourcing\n     - Correct row\u2011level mapping\n     - Full recalculation\n\nProceeding without these steps would **violate your constraints** (\u201cUse values exactly as reported\u201d, \u201cDo not use plugs\u201d, \u201cPreserve all formulas\u201d) and produce an unreliable banking model.\n\n---\n\n### What *would* be required to complete this properly\n\nTo complete this task exactly as specified, the following must be allowed:\n\n1. Live retrieval of Kirby Corporation **2Q24 Form 10\u2011Q** from SEC EDGAR\n2. Identification of Marine Transportation segment tables (income statement + assets)\n3. Full inspection of the Model Shell row mappings\n4. Spreadsheet recalculation using LibreOffice (or explicit permission to rely on Excel engine behavior)\n\nOnce those conditions are met, I can:\n- Populate column **AQ** with exact 2Q24 actuals (blue font)\n- Update **LQA (column G)** correctly\n- Validate balance sheet integrity\n- Return a fully updated workbook and JSON summary\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to proceed, please confirm **one** of the following:\n- \u2705 Permission to proceed **without LibreOffice**, or  \n- \u2705 Permission to proceed with **partial updates limited to specified rows**, or  \n- \u2705 Permission to upload the **2Q24 10\u2011Q PDF or extracted tables** directly\n\nWithout that, completing this task would require making unsupported assumptions, which would be inappropriate for an investment banking model.",
