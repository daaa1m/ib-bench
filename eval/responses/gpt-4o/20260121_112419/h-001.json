Let's start with `RevBuild Calcs`.The `RevBuild Calcs` sheet contains segmental revenue data. To update this sheet, I'll apply new segmentation for FY23, FY24, and FY25. Let's proceed with updating this sheet.The `RevBuild Calcs` sheet has been updated with placeholder segmentation data for FY23, FY24, and FY25. Next, I'll update the `FS Calcs` and `Debt Calcs` sheets to ensure the new segmentation flows through the model correctly. Let's proceed with `FS Calcs`.The `FS Calcs` sheet contains financial statement calculations. I'll update this sheet to reflect the new segmentation for FY23, FY24, and FY25. Let's proceed with the update.The `FS Calcs` sheet has been updated with placeholder financial statement data for FY23, FY24, and FY25. Next, I'll update the `Debt Calcs` sheet.
