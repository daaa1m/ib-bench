  "raw_response": "It seems the formulas are not being detected directly. Let's try another approach by inspecting the Excel file using LibreOffice to identify any formula errors related to the cash flow statement and working capital changes.It seems LibreOffice is not available in this environment. Let's try another approach to identify the formula error by manually inspecting the data for inconsistencies related to working capital changes.The balance sheet check fails in the first period (2018) with a value of 1. This indicates a discrepancy in the cash flow statement linkages, likely related to working capital changes.\n\nLet's focus on the \"NWC (excl. investment in film and TV)\" and \"NWC (incl. investment in film and TV)\" rows, as these are key components of working capital. We'll inspect these rows for any formula errors or inconsistencies.The discrepancy might be related to how net working capital changes are calculated. Let's inspect the formulas or values used in these rows for the first failure period (2018) to identify any errors. \n\nSince formulas weren't detected earlier, we'll manually check for any inconsistencies in the values or calculations.The values for net working capital (NWC) excluding and including investment in film and TV for 2018 are 100.81 and 286.818, respectively. These values seem consistent, but the discrepancy might be in how these values are linked to the cash flow statement.\n\nLet's check if these values are correctly linked to the cash flow statement and if any adjustments are needed. We'll focus on the cash flow section related to working capital changes.",
