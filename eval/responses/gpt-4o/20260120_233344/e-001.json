  "raw_response": "To identify the error, let's follow the systematic accounting checks:\n\n1. **Circularity Control:** The model likely has embedded circularity, but the error seems to be a static linkage issue rather than a logic flow problem.\n\n2. **Variance Analysis:**\n   - **Break Year:** The discrepancy appears in the first year where the check row is non-zero, which is 2021.\n   - **Error Behavior:** The variance is a constant value, suggesting an opening balance or hard-code error.\n\n3. **The \"Half-Number\" Sign Check:** The variance is not a specific dollar amount that suggests a sign-convention flip.\n\n4. **Linkage Integrity:**\n   - **Summation Ranges:** Ensure all line items are captured in Total Assets and Total Liabilities & Equity.\n   - **Golden Rule:** Check if every period-to-period change in non-cash assets and liabilities on the Balance Sheet is reflected exactly once on the Cash Flow Statement.\n   - **Cash Link:** Verify the Ending Cash from the CFS is linked to the Balance Sheet.\n\n### Findings\n\n- **Error Location:** The error is likely in the linkage of Ending Cash from the Cash Flow Statement to the Balance Sheet.\n- **Current Formula:** The Ending Cash in the Cash Flow Statement (row 148) should be linked to the Balance Sheet.\n- **Corrected Formula:** Ensure the Ending Cash from the Cash Flow Statement is correctly linked to the Balance Sheet's cash line item.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error_location\": \"Row 148\",\n  \"current_formula\": \"Check the linkage of Ending Cash from CFS to Balance Sheet\",\n  \"corrected_formula\": \"Link Ending Cash from CFS to Balance Sheet's cash line item\",\n  \"logical_explanation\": \"The Ending Cash from the Cash Flow Statement is not correctly linked to the Balance Sheet, causing a discrepancy.\",\n  \"audit_steps_followed\": [\"Circularity Control\", \"Variance Analysis\", \"Linkage Integrity\"]\n}\n```",
