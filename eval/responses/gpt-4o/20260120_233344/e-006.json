Added a circularity switch in cell B5 to toggle circularity on/off.\"\n}\n```\n\nThe Total Cash Interest values are currently `null`, likely due to the need for enabling iterative calculations in Excel to resolve circular references. Please ensure iterative calculations are enabled in your Excel settings.",
