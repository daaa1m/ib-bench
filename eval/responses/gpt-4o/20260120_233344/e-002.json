FTI has been impacted by internal disputes and the departure of key personnel, notably Jonathan Orszag, leading to a decline in its economic consulting unit's EBITDA from $35.2 million to a deficit of $4.6 million. Despite these challenges, FTI remains a significant force in the industry, representing top law firms and Fortune Global 100 corporations. The company has engaged in substantial share repurchases, totaling $846.1 million, and announced a new $500 million buyback authorization. FTI's balance sheet shows $364 million in net debt, equal to 0.8 times trailing EBITDA. The article also highlights broader market conditions, including the impact of tariffs and the Supreme Court case questioning the executive branch's authority to levy taxes. The potential economic fallout from an adverse ruling could result in $3 trillion in lost import revenue and investments. These elements underscore the strategic implications for FTI and similar firms, as they navigate a complex landscape of regulatory and economic challenges.\"\n}\n```",
