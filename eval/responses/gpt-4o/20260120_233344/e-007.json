Goldman Sachs reiterates its 'Buy' rating and raises its price target to $330, driven by strong performance in Google Services and Cloud segments. The report highlights a 15% YoY growth in Google Search revenue and a 34% increase in Google Cloud revenue, underscoring Alphabet's robust position in the digital economy. Goldman Sachs also notes the increased capex guidance to $91-93 billion, reflecting continued investment in infrastructure, which is expected to sustain growth into 2026.\n\nJPMorgan, on the other hand, assigns an 'Overweight' rating with a price target of $340, emphasizing Alphabet's potential in Generative AI and its ability to innovate across various segments. The report points to Alphabet's strong fundamentals, including a healthy runway in Search and YouTube ads, and significant headroom in non-ad businesses like Cloud and YouTube subscriptions. JPMorgan also highlights the option value in Alphabet's Other Bets, such as Waymo and Verily, which could drive future growth.\n\nBoth reports agree on the importance of AI and infrastructure investments as key drivers of Alphabet's valuation. Goldman Sachs focuses on the immediate impact of increased capex and strong revenue growth, while JPMorgan looks at long-term innovation and strategic positioning in AI. The synthesis of these perspectives suggests that Alphabet's valuation is supported by its current revenue growth and future potential in AI and cloud services, with infrastructure investments playing a crucial role in sustaining this trajectory.\"\n}\n```",
