We'll start by parsing the relevant financial data for each segment and year.The financial data is organized by segment and year. We'll use this to build the LBO model, starting with the operating forecast. Let's proceed with the revenue projections for each segment.It seems there was an error due to the \"Total Output\" row being included. Let's adjust the code to exclude this row and recalculate the revenue projections.The error persists because the index still includes \"Total Output.\" Let's ensure we correctly exclude it and recalculate.The revenue projections for each segment from 2021 to 2025 have been calculated. Next, we'll proceed with the cost of sales and operating expenses projections.The projections for cost of sales and operating expenses are complete. Next, we'll calculate EBITDA and proceed with the valuation and EV-to-Equity bridge.The EBITDA projections are ready. Now, let's proceed with the valuation and EV-to-Equity bridge, starting with the entry valuation.The entry enterprise value is approximately \u20ac347.62 million, and the entry equity value is approximately \u20ac302.62 million. Next, we'll set up the sources and uses table for the transaction.The Sources and Uses table is balanced. Now, let's calculate the returns, including MOIC and IRR, assuming an exit at the end of 2025.",
