  "raw_response": "The \"LBO\" sheet contains various sections, including transaction assumptions, sources and uses, and financing assumptions. Let's focus on the Returns section and trace backwards to identify errors. I'll start by examining the relevant cells for MOIC, cash flow, and debt schedule calculations.The Returns section includes key metrics like cash interest, BoP cash, net cash flows, and EoP cash. Let's focus on the MOIC calculation and trace back to identify any discrepancies in the cash flow and debt schedule. I'll also check the formulas in these cells.The current values for MOIC, EoP cash, and Exit equity are:\n\n- MOIC (L166): -0.83\n- EoP Cash (L156): 446.96\n- Exit Equity (L164): 0.99\n\nThese values indicate potential errors. Let's trace back through the cash flow and debt schedule to identify the issues.The cash flow and debt schedule sections reveal potential issues with interest calculations and debt repayments. Let's examine the formulas in these sections to identify any errors.The formulas for EoP cash, MOIC, Exit equity, and Net debt seem standard. Let's verify if the calculations are correctly implemented in the Excel file, focusing on these areas:\n\n1. **EoP Cash (L156):** Check if it's correctly summing BoP cash and Net cash flows.\n2. **MOIC (L166):** Ensure it divides Exit equity by Initial equity.\n3. **Exit Equity (L164):** Verify it subtracts Net debt from Exit EV.\n4. **Net Debt:** Confirm it subtracts EoP cash from Total debt.\n\nI'll now check these calculations in the Excel file.The values for BoP cash, Net cash flows, and Total debt are:\n\n- BoP Cash (L152): 231.51\n- Net Cash Flows (L153): 215.44\n- Total Debt (L140): 469.74\n\nLet's verify the calculations for EoP cash, MOIC, and Exit equity using these values.The calculations show:\n\n- **EoP Cash:** Correct at 446.96\n- **Net Debt:** 22.78\n- **Exit Equity:** 200.17\n\nThe MOIC calculation resulted in `NaN`, indicating a potential issue with the initial equity value. Let's check the initial equity value in cell L160.The initial equity value in cell L160 is `NaN`, which is causing the MOIC calculation to fail. This is likely a key error. Let's correct this by identifying the correct initial equity value.The \"Data\" sheet doesn't directly show initial equity. Let's assume it's a known value or calculate it from other financial data. If you have a specific initial equity value, please provide it. Otherwise, I'll proceed with assumptions based on typical LBO structures.",
